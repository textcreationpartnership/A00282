            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If any man thinke that a few good miniſters, wil not ſerue to bring the people of God, vnto God: will he therfore conclude, that he may lawfully appoint many Miniſters of the diuels culling, to bring them to the deuill?

The law which the enemy vnto the Lorde, did make in the time of popery, for maintenance of popiſh procurations, popiſh diſpenſations, popiſh ceremonies: popiſh non reſidentes: popiſh exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munications: popiſh viſitations: popiſh paiments of oblations: popiſh courts of faculties: popiſh licences: the very ſame lawes, and the ſelfe ſame ordinances, to ſerue their owne turnes, they turne to the maintenance of their prelacies, dignities, and miniſteries vnder the Goſpell.

               <p>In theſe two aunſweres and demaundes laſt ſpecified, are principally contayned two things. Firſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter chargeth himſelfe, by a ſolemne vow, to teache, and inſtruct the people committed to his charge, with the doctrine of holy ſcriptures. <note place="margin">The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by Parliament.</note> Secondly, the Biſhop by vertue of the order, and forme appointed by act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, bindeth him as well to miniſter the Diſcipline of Chriſt, within his cure, as the doctrine &amp; ſacraments of Chriſte, as the Lorde hath commaunded, and as this realme hath receiued it according to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. And therefore euery Miniſter, by vertue of this ſtatute law, may as well admoniſh, denounce, and excommunicate offendours within his charge, as a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop may within his Dioceſſe, the wordes are copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and therfore. <hi>Non ſufficit alterum, ſed oportet vtrum<expan>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> fieri.</hi> It is not ſufficient to do one, but both. And theſe wordes before rehearſed. [Will you giue your faithfull diligence, alwayes to Miniſter the Doctrine and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and Diſcipline of Chriſte, as the Lorde hath commaunded, and as this Realme hath receyued the ſame, according to the commandements of God] haue in them two ſpeciall points to be conſidered: one tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the doctrine and ſacraments of Chriſt: the other concerning the diſcipline of Chriſte: out of which two braunches, proceed two other queſtions. Firſt, whether euery miniſter, ought not, to exerciſe the Diſcipline of Chriſt, by force of this demaunde and aunſwere, as well as the doctrine &amp; ſacraments. Secondly, whether theſe, namely the doctrine, ſacramentes, and the diſcipline be to be miniſtred ſimply, as the Lord hath commaunded, or els whether they be to be miniſtred onely, as this realme hath receiued the ſame without the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God? For theſe wordes, [according to the commandements of God] are but <hi>Synonima,</hi> vnto thoſe which went before [<hi>Viz.</hi> as the Lord hath commanded] and ſo ſignifie both but one thing. To the firſt his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1795:21"/> owne promiſe, to the Byſhoppes interrogatorie, binde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him as well to miniſter the Diſcipline, as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Sacramentes. To the ſeconde, if you aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that the doctrine and Sacramentes, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſt, are ſimplie to be miniſtred, as the Lorde hath commaunded: then it muſt needes followe, if this Realme hath receyued the ſame, according to the commaundement of God, that the law of the Realme, and the Lawe of God commaunde both one thing, and ſo by both Lawes, the doctrine and Sacramentes and Diſcipline, are to bee miniſtred as the Lorde hath commaunded. But if you ſhall ſaye, that theſe thinges are to bee miniſtred onely, as this Realme hath receyued the ſame, though not according to the commaundement of God; then theſe wordes of the Article following, viz. [As this Realme hath receyued the ſame according to the commaundement of God] conuinceth you of a ſlaunderous tongue, agaynſt the whole ſtate and Churche of God. For hereby you accuſe them of great impietie and vngodlineſſe, and attaynt them of high Treaſon, to the Maieſtie of God, as though the intent of the whole ſtate, were to haue the Doctrine and Sacramente, and Diſcipline of Chriſte, miniſtred according to the commaundements of God; in caſe the Lawes of the Realme, had ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the ſame, and not otherwiſe: And ſo to haue reſtrayned the commaundementes of God by the Lawes of the Realme, and ſo to haue concluded an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibilitie, limiting and reſtrayning the greater by the leſſe; and a Lawe moſt perfecte, by a Lawe vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, and not rather the contrarie, to haue reſtrayned in deede the leſſe, by the greater: the Lawes of the Realme, by the commaundementes of God: an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecte Law; the Lawe of man, by a moſt perfecte and abſolute Lawe, the Lawe of the moſt Higheſt, whiche
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1795:21"/> is manifeſt by a threefolde repetition of the one, as the Diſcipline of CHRISTE: Secondly as the Lord commaunded: Thirdly, according to the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God: where the Laws of the Realm, are but once onely mentioned. Again, in the ordering of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops, the Archbiſhopp demaundeth of the Biſhop this queſtion. [Will you maintain &amp; ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, as much as ſhall lye in you, quietnes peace, and loue, amongeſt all men, and ſuch as be vnquiet, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and cryminous, within your Dioceſſe, correct, and punniſhe, according to ſuch authoritie, as yee haue by Gods worde, and as to you ſhall bee committed by the ordinaunce of this Realme? Doe theſe wordes, (and as to you ſhal be committed by the ordinaunce of the Realme) reſtrayne and lymitte theſe wordes which went before, to correcte, and to punniſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuche Authoritie, as yee haue by Gods worde.]</p>
               <p>Surely, they can haue no ſuch interpretation. For the meaning of theſe wordes is, that euery Byſhoppe ſhoulde by the ordinauuce of the Realme, haue his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice committed vnto him, and once hauing his office ſo committed vnto him by the ordinaunce of the Realm: then to correcte and punniſhe according to ſuche au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as hee hath committed vnto him by Gods worde: and as he is appoynted by the ordinaunce of the Realme to execute. Neyther hath the Biſhoppe any authoritie giuen him by theſe wordes, to correct, or punniſhe any, otherwiſe then the Lawes of GOD permitte him, though the Lawes of the Realme, were not agreeable to the Lawe of GOD. And in like caſe I conclude, that a miniſter bounde, as you haue ſeene before, to miniſter the Diſcipline of Chriſte, ought ſo too miniſter the ſame, as the Lorde hath commaunded, though the Lawes of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1795:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> the realm, ſhold not haue receiued the ſame. For no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in truth, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſaid to be the diſcipline of Chriſt, vnleſſe it be in deed miniſtred, as the Lorde Chriſt hath commaunded the ſame ſhould be miniſtred. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as no biſhop may or ought to correct or puniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tranſgreſſour, any otherwiſe then according to the lawes of God: ſo no miniſter ought to exerciſe any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, then ſuch as the Lord Chriſt hath commanded. If it be alleadged, that our diſcipline vſed in the church of Englande, be in very deede the very ſame diſcipline, which the Lorde Chriſt hath commaunded, (which is vtterly vntrue) as appeareth. Firſt and principally by the word of god. Secondly, by the diſcourſes writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the learned on that behalfe: Thirdly, by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline practized by all the reformed churches: and laſtly, by maiſter Nowell his Catechiſme, commaunded generally by the biſhop to be taught vnto the youth of the realme in all ſchooles of their Dioceſſe: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the miniſter contrary to a vowe made by him at the commaundement of his Ordinarie, appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thervnto by lawe, is very iniuriouſly dealt with, for that he is not permitted to exerciſe any diſcipline at al: our Biſhops and Archdeacons challenging vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a principal prerogatiue, to puniſh al malefactors, within their ſeuerall iuriſdictions. An other reaſon, that this ſtatute hath appoynted, as well the diſcipline of Chriſt, as the doctrine and ſacramentes to be miniſtred as the Lord commaunded onely, and none otherwyſe is this: namely, for that this ſtatute was made, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme as well the diſordered diſcipline vſed in the time of popery, amongſt the popiſh idolatrous Prieſtes: as it was to reprooue their falſe doctrine and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſacraments: ſo that neither the one, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the other, ſhould be miniſtred by the miniſters of the Goſpell; for otherwiſe, this branch of the ſtatute, ſhould ordayne nothing, &amp; ſo contrary to the nature of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1795:22"/> a Law, be <hi>Lex abſurda,</hi> an abſurd Law. And therfore, what open wrong &amp; intollerable iniury is offered the Saintes of God, &amp; loyal ſubiects to her Maieſtie, calling for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, at the cheefe Prelates handes, commaunded by the Lord, and in trueth eſtabliſhed by the Lawes of her highneſſe Empire: euery indifferent man, may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. It followeth in the Booke of making of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>

               <p>In the end when hee layeth on his handes, he ſayth to euery one: Be thou a faithfull Diſpenſer of the worde of God, and of his holy Sacraments. And againe, Take thou authority to preach the word of god, and to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the holy Sacramentes. Which action and Speeches of the Biſhop, are to bee well wayed, and conſidered. The words which the Byſhop pronounceth: [Be thou a Faithful diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſer] &amp;c. [Take thou authority to preach] are wordes appoynted him by the whole State to bee pronounced: What? was it trowe you, the meaning of all the States and Nobles of the Realme? or was it our moſt excellent Soueraigne, the Queenes Highneſſe her pleaſure, to haue enacted by Parliament, that a Byſhop
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1795:23"/> ſhould commaund an Apothecarie not exerciſed at all in holy ſcriptures, and altogeather vnable to teache, to bee notwithſtanding a faythfull diſpenſor of the worde of God, and to take authoritie to preache: No, no, they verie well knew, that the outward ſound of the biſhoppes wordes, in the eares of ſuch a man, coulde not worke any inwarde grace, or giue any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde vertue, to the perfourmaunce of ſo high a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or of ſo holy a function. And therefore as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a true and loyall ſubiect, I dare not for my part, ſo diſhonourablye conceyue of their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, much leſſe, I take it, ſhoulde the Biſhop ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyallye abuſe their credite and authoritie. Was their intente and purpoſe trowe you, that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop by theſe his demaundes, and the miniſter by theſe his aunſweres, ſhoulde not bynde the miniſter him ſelfe, to perfourme by him ſelfe this duetie to preach, but that the ſame ſhould be done by a thirde perſonne? I trowe no. For my maiſters and Doctors of the Canon and Ciuile Lawe, Burgeſſes in the houſe of Parliament know, <note place="margin">Inſtitu. de invtili. ſtipu. § ſi quis.</note> that <hi>Promſſio facti alieni mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis eſt, &amp; quod ſi testator iuſſerit aliquem in certum locum abire, vel liberalibus ſtudiis imbui, vel domum ſuis manibus extruere vel pingere, vel vxorem ducere, per alium id facere non poteſt, quia haec omnia testatoris voluntas in ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius ſolius perſona intelligitur concluſiſſe.</hi> A promiſe made of an other mans fact, is vnprofitable, and that if a Teſtator ſhall will any to goe to a certayne place, or to be furniſhed with the liberall Sciences, or to buylde an houſe, or to paynt a Table with his owne handes, or to marry a Wyfe: that he can not doe any of theſe thinges by an other man, becauſe the will of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator hath concluded all theſe thinges onely in his owne perſon. Was their meaning that the biſhop pronouncing theſe wordes. [Be thou a diſpenſor] was their meaning, I ſaye, by thoſe wordes, to haue the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1795:23"/> biſhop committe the office of reading Homilies to a miniſter, or to iudge reading of Homilies to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching? No, no: Their proceedinges appeare to bee of greater wiſedome, knowledge, iudgement, diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Godlineſſe. They appoynted, by the ſame their conſultation, three kindes of offices to bee in the Church: Deacons, Miniſters, and Biſhoppes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynting ſeuerally, to euery officer his ſeuerall due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, and hath expreſly appoynted reading Homilies, to bee the office of a Deacon. For in the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Deacons, the Biſhoppe, by vertue of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, pronounceth theſe wordes vnto the Deacon. [It pertayneth to the office of a Deacon in the church, where he ſhall be appoynted, to aſſiſte the Prieſt in deuine ſeruice, and ſpeciallye when hee miniſtereth the holye Communion, and to helpe him in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution thereof, and to reade holye ſcriptures, and Homilies in the congregation,] &amp;c. I take it, and holde it for a principle, that the Biſhop hath no authoritie, by his Lordſhip, to alter or transforme an Act of Parliament, and therefore I take it, that I maye ſafelye conclude, without offence to his Lordſhippe, that he can not by lawe appoynt anye miniſter, to reade anye Homilies in anye Church, Statute lawe is <hi>Stricti Iuris,</hi> and maye not be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>What will you then by lawe poſitiue, barre reading of Homilies in the Churche? No. But I woulde haue the Lawe, poſitiue obſerued, and ſo barre rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Homilies from a Miniſter, becauſe the Lawe poſitiue, hath appoynted that office to a Deacon. For it is not lawefull, for one priuate man, and fellowe ſeruaunt, to tranſpoſe from his fellowe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, an office committed vnto him by publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1795:24"/>
               <p>And it is verily to be thought, the biſhop him ſelfe, will challenge as much vnto him ſelfe by this ſtatute from the miniſter; and plainly tell him, that by this ſtatute, he alone hath authoritie, to make Deacons, and miniſters, and to gouerne them, and that therefore, it beſeemeth not a miniſter, to be ordered otherwiſe, then according to the forme of the booke, &amp; no otherwiſe to preach, then as he ſhall be licenſed therevnto, by him the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. As touching the iniunctions, the aduertiſments, and the articles of religion, wherein mention is made ſometimes: that Parſons, Vicars, and Curates; ſomtimes that the miniſter ſhall reade Homilies, they may eaſely be reconciled by this ſtatute. For the iniunctions ſet foorth <hi>primo Elizabeth,</hi> the aduertiſementes and articles ſet foorth <hi>ſeptimo Elizabeth,</hi> and this ſtatute, being made 8. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſo ſince, doth bounde, and limit the meaning of the iniunctions and aduertiſementes. For whereas before, the names were vſed in them confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; this ſtatute, doth aptly diſtinguiſh them, applying properly euery proper office, to his proper officer, and bringing thoſe names before recited, vnto two principal heades. For though there be parſons, Vicars, Curates &amp; miniſters generally in the Church, of whom mention is made in the iniunctions, articles, and aduertiſementes: Yet theſe, and euery one of theſe, muſt by this ſtatute, be either a Deacon or a miniſter ſpecially. And beeing a Deacon, he ought to execute the office of a Deacon, and being a miniſter, the office of a miniſter by this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: and ſo a Deacon if he be a Parſon, vicar, or Curate, he muſt execute the office of a Deacon onely; that is, he muſt read the ſcriptures and Homilies by this ſtatute. Likewiſe, a miniſter if he be a Parſon, Vicar, or Curate, he muſt miniſter the doctrine and ſacraments, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Chriſt: he muſt be a diſpenſor of the word of God; and he muſt preach onely, and yet in ſaying that he muſt preach onely, I do not exclude him from doing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1795:24"/> thoſe other dutyes, <hi>Sine quibus illud fieri non poteſt.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not preach, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reading the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and praying with the people: but I exclude him from thoſe thinges onely, which are not incident to his office, as from reading of Homilies: for he may preach, and neuer read Homilies: but he can not preach pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablie, vnleſſe he reade the ſcriptures and vſe prayer. What will you then by law poſitiue barre all miniſters, that be Parſons, Vicars, or Curates, and yet can not preach, from reading Homilies? I aunſwere, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can preach or can not preach. <hi>Currat lex, Let the law runne, and let him that hath defiled his handes by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them vppon ſuch a one, contrary to the commaundement of the Lorde, and contrary to the lawes of his gouernour vnder whom he liueth, and by whom he hath his preferment, holde vp his guyltie handes vnto the Lorde; for mercy in the day of the Lord, and fall downe before hir highneſſe for hir gratious pardon, in ſo abuſing hir highneſſe lawes.</hi> And to the ende, you may ſee more apparauntly, theſe two offices, by the lawe it ſelfe, to be thus diſtinguiſhed, I haue ſet downe the Bi. wordes pronounced by vertue of the ſtatute vnto the miniſters, as followeth. [You haue hearde brethren, as well in your priuate examination, as in the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the holy leſſons taken out of the Goſpell, &amp; out of the wrytinges of the Apoſtles, of what dignitie, and of how great importaunce this office is, whervnto yee be called: and moreouer, exhort you in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to haue in remembraunce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to how high a dignitie, and to how chargeable an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice yee be called: that is to ſaye, to be the meſſengers, the watchmen, the Paſtours, and the ſtewardes of the Lorde, to teach, to premoniſh, to feede, and prouide for the Lordes familie, to ſeeke for Chriſt his ſheepe, that be diſperſed abroade, and for his children which be in the middeſt of this nuaghty worlde, to be ſaued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Chriſt for euer: haue alwayes therefore printed in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1795:25"/> your remembraunce, how great a treaſury is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your charge, for they be the ſheepe of Chriſte, which he bought with his death, and for whom he ſhed his bloud: the Church and congregation whom you muſt ſerue, is his ſpouſe and his body, and if ye ſhall ſee the ſame Church or any member thereof, to take anye hurt or hinderauuce, by reaſon of your negligence; yee know the greatneſſe of your faulte, and alſo of the horrible punniſhment which will enſue. Wherefore conſider with your ſelues, the ende of your miniſterie towardes the children of GOD, towarde the ſpouſe and bodie of Chriſte, and ſee that yee neuer ceaſe your labour, your care and diligence, vntill you haue done all that lyeth in you, according to your bounden duetie, to bring all ſuch as are, or ſhall bee committed to your charge, vnto that agreement in faith and knowledge of GOD, and to that ripeneſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſſe of age in Chriſte, that there be no place left among them, either for errour in religion, or for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe in life. As here you ſee the whole ſumme of the office of a Miniſter recited by Act of Parliament, and pronounced by the Biſhoppe: So in the whole action of ordering Miniſters both the biſhops inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories, and the parties aunſweres, and all tende to admoniſhe the Miniſter ſtill of his duetie, in teaching and inſtructyng the people, and in preaching. Where the whole action of ordering Deacons, tendeth to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhe the Deacon of his office in reading: As thus. [Will you diligently reade the ſame vnto the people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the Church, where you ſhall be appoynted to ſerue.]</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1795:25"/> And againe, [take thou authoritie to execute the office of a Deacon in the Churche of God, and take thou authoritie to reade the Goſpell in the Church of God.] And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of them appoynted by the Biſhop, ſhall reade the Goſpell of that day. And no doubt the whole houſe of Parliament, had a ſingular care to haue theſe offices diſtinguiſhed by their lawe, euen as they are diſtinguiſhed by the lawe of Chriſte him felfe, as appeareth both by the places of ſcripture, appoynted by the ſtatute to be reade for euery office: And alſo by appoynting the prouiſion for the poore vnto the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. And furthermore, it is his office, ſayth the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop by the ſame ſtatute, where prouiſion is ſo made, to ſearch for the ſicke, poore, and impotent people of the parriſhe, and to intimate their eſtates, names, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they dwell to the Curate, that by his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they be relieued by the parriſhe, or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient almoſe. And therefore I conclude againe, that the Biſhop can no more appoynt the office of prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the poore vnto a Miniſter, then he can change or alter an Act of Paliament: And therfore, that he can no more commaunde a miniſter to reade Homilies, then hee can commaunde him to make prouiſion for the poore. For as touching theſe wordes towarde the latter ende of this action. [Take authoritie to preache where thou ſhalt be appoynted]: Whereby they take holde, no otherwiſe to ſuffer them to preach, then as they ſhalbe licenſed afterward by wryting, hath neither head nor tayle. They make, by their fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patience, a conſtruction thereof, without all ryme or reaſon. They expounde (<hi>Where</hi>) which is a worde ſignifying place, and referred to a place, for (<hi>When</hi>) which is a worde importing time. But had this worde (<hi>When</hi>) beene placed inſteed of (<hi>Where</hi>) they might perhaps, haue had ſome cloak for the raine, for ſo the worde (<hi>When</hi>) and the word (<hi>Shalt</hi>) might
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1795:26"/> both haue had relation to the time to come. And yet notwithſtanding, this kind of ſpeach, would haue been but a harſhe kinde of ſpeach: namely, to ſaye; [Take thou authoritie to preache, when thou ſhalte haue authoritie to preach] couplinge the preſent tenſe with the future tenſe, the time preſent, with the time to come, applying that to them ſelues but men, which is onely proper and peculiar to the holy Ghoſt: vſing the future tenſe, and the time to come, for the certaintie of the euent thereof, inſtead of the preſent tenſe, and the time preſent: But theſe wordes [take thou authoritie to preache the worde to the congregation, in the place where thou ſhalt be appointed] is a very proper kinde of ſpeach, and the wordes them ſelues, carrie with them a naturall ſence: As if the ſtatute ſhould haue preciſely and abſolutely ſayd thus: In what place ſoeuer, thou ſhalt hereafter be appoynted to execute the office of a miniſter, thou haſt now authority giuen thee to preach. For in caſe this were not the naturall meaning of the ſtatute, they might well forbid the miniſter to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacramentes, without ſpeciall licence in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or not to pray, or not to faſt, or not to ſay ſeruice, or not to bury the dead, &amp; ſuch like.

If I ſaye vnto one, by worde of mouth, Syr, take here the key of the gate of my paſture, where my Grey ambling Gelding runneth, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gate, bring him out, take him to your owne vſe: I giue him you franckly, hath he not as good a title and intereſt to my horſe, as if I had made him a bill of ſale, vnder my hande and ſeale? And hath not the miniſter likewiſe, as well a ſpeciall licenſe, from a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to preach, that is willed openly in the preſence of God, men and Angels: as he, that hath a ſpecial licence giuen him alone in a corner: the one is pronounced, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly in the middeſt of the congregation: the other is done ſecreatly, by a gooſe quill. Moreouer, neither doth the foreſayde Canon, neither yet the Iniunction, require a ſpecial licence in wryting, to the ende, that the miniſter ſhoulde haue power thereby onely to preache. For ſo ſhoulde you take away the forme and order, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted by act of Parliament, whereby authoritie is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to a miniſter to preach, and commit the making of a miniſter to the Biſhop, without a congregation. But the ende, why a ſpeciall licence, ought to be had, is not ſo much, for the partie him ſelfe to preach within his owne cure, as for them, that ſhall admit him to preach out of his owne cure: And that appeareth manifeſtly by the eight Article of the iniunctions. The wordes are theſe. [Alſo that they ſhall admit no man within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their cures, but ſuch as ſhall appeare vnto them to be ſufficiently licenſed therevnto, &amp;c.] And in the ende of this Iniunction, it is expreſly permitted, to euery mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1795:27"/> to preach within his owne cure, though he be not ſpecially licenſed therevnto. The wordes are theſe: [And that no other be ſuffred, to preach out of his own cure or parriſh, then ſuch, as ſhal be licenſed, as is before expreſſed] therfore, a miniſter to preach within his own cure, yea thogh he haue no licence, is commaunded. In the time of Henry the 4. at what time Wyckliffe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Goſpel, the very ſame lawes were eſtabliſhed againſt him and his brethren, to ſtaye the courſe of the Goſpell and yet were neuer any forbidden to preach in their owne parriſhes, as appeareth by that, that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth [Let no man within this Realme, or other the kings Dominions, preſume or take vpon him to preach priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or apertly, without ſpeciall licence, firſte obtayned of the ordinarie of the ſame place, Curates in their owne parriſh churches, and perſons heretofore priuiledged, &amp; others admitted by the Canon law only excepted.

Out of which concluſions, I collect this rule: Namely, that where a ſtatute ſhall eſtabliſh an office, practized and had in vſe before the making of the ſtatute, and ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a calling, a triall, an examination, and qualities in an officer, meete to execute that office, and ſhall not ſpecifie and declare any particular kinde of calling, of tryall, of examination, and ſuch qualities, &amp;c. That then ſuch maner of calling, of tryall, of examination, &amp; ſuch qualities, are requyred by that ſtatute to be in ſuch an officer, as by common right were requiſite for ſuch an officer before the making of that ſtatute. And becauſe by the viewe of the former order it ſelfe, it is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant that the ſame forme and order was appoynted, by men very deſirous to promote, as much as in them lay, the honour and glory of God, and to aboliſh all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions and trumperies brought into his Church: Therefore becauſe I ought by dutie, to conceiue their meaning to the beſt, and moſt agreeable to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: I ſay, that they ment herein, onely ſuch calling, ſuch triall, ſuch examination, and ſuch qualities, as are requiſite to be in a Deacon, and in a miniſter by the lawe of God. Which is euident both by the order of prayer vſed at the time of their orderinges, and alſo by the ſcripture read for that purpoſe. The prayer follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. [Almighty God, which by thy diuine prouidence haſt appoynted diuers orders of miniſters in the Church, and diddeſt inſpire thine holye Apoſtles, to chooſe vnto this order of Deacons, the firſt martyr S.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1795:28"/> Steuen with other; mercifully beholde theſe thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, nowe called to the like office and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: repleniſh them ſo with the trueth of thy doctrine, and innocencie of life, that both by worde and good example, they may faythfully ſerue thee in this office, to the glorie of thy Name, and profite of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, thorowe the merits of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who liueth and raigneth with thee and the holy Ghoſt, now and euer, Amen.</p>
               <p>After this prayer, followeth the Epiſtle out of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie.</hi> Likewiſe, muſt the Miniſters be honeſt, not double tonged, not giuen to much wine, neyther greedie of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie lucre, but holding the Miſterie of the fayth with a true conſcience.

               <p>Then the twelue, called the multitude of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples together, and ſayde, It is not meete, that wee ſhoulde leaue the worde of GOD and ſerue tables: wherefore brethren, looke yee out among you ſeuen men of honeſt report, and full of the holy Ghoſte and wiſedome, to whome wee may commit this buſineſſe, but wee will giue our ſelues to continuall prayer, and to the adminiſtration of the worde.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1795:33"/> a miniſter, is not apropried to the B. alone. Firſt by the ſtatu. 25. H. 8. theſe lawe, Canons, &amp; decrees before ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, being then in force, in as much, as they be neither contrariant, nor repugnant to the lawes &amp; cuſtomes of the realm, nor derogatorie to the Queenes prerogatiue royall, are confirmed, ratifyed, and in force now. Yea becauſe they are agreable to the lawes and cuſtomes of the realme, and maintaine her prerogatiue royall, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes ſhall be declared, they ought now to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Secondly by a ſtatute made 21. of H. the 8. cap. 13. It is enacted. that a Bi. may haue 6.

And theſe wordes: the B. ſhall ſay vnto the people. Brethren if there be any, &amp;c. And theſe wordes the bi. commending ſuch to the prayers of the congregation, with the Cleargy and people preſent ſhal ſay, &amp;c. Then ſhal the B. examine euery one of them that are to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the preſence of the people. By which words &amp; branches of the book, it is euident, that, that people, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer whom the miniſter is to be placed, ought eſpecially to be preſent. For what profit can a people, dwelling at Yorke reape, by exhortation of the preacher vnto loue &amp; obedience of their miniſter, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their miniſter ſhalbe made at London? Her highnes, the nobilitie and fathers of the land, were of more wiſdom &amp; vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I am ſure, then to imagine, that a people dwelling at Carlyle, coulde be taught or inſtructed by a ſermon made at Exeter. And by the former decrees wherin me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of people &amp; citizens, the ſame people and citizens (if we will know what citizens be properly) are not taken for the Quiriſters, the Singers, the Organ players, the Canons, the Archdeacon of the Cathedrall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1795:34"/> Church (for all theſe by the Canon law beare the names of Clearkes) neither are the biſhops ſeruauntes, taken in theſe Canons, for Citizens, becauſe Citizens, by theſe rules, muſt giue their conſentes, and as hauing a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall intereſt in the action, muſt not onely be eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and eare witneſſes to the biſhops vpright dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but alſo muſt be agents and cohelpers themſelues. But <hi>ſerui</hi> and <hi>domeſtici in re non domeſtica.</hi> Seruauntes, and folke domeſticall, in a thing not domeſticall, are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed fit witneſſes, neither haue ſeruantes, as ſeruants, anye intereſt: And therefore Citizens in theſe former Canons are Citizens, <hi>Et re, &amp; nomine,</hi> Citizens in deede, and in name. And as I prooued before out of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the land, thatas the people of the place, deſtitut of a Paſtour muſt be preſent, and giue their conſent at the choyce of their miniſter, ſo is the ſame alſo ſtably<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by act of Parliament. <note place="margin">Gloſ. in c. 1. de reb. eccle. non alienand ver. tractatus lib. 6.</note> For this worde <hi>conſenſus, ſiue collaudatio,</hi> conſent or approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſcribed to be <hi>multorum voluntas, ad quos res pertinet ſimul iniuncta:</hi> The will of many; vnto whom, the matter appertayneth, ioyntly linked togeather, prooueth that not onely Citizens in deed, but alſo, that Citizens of the place, where the partie ſhould afterwardes ſerue as a miniſter, ought to giue their conſent and allowance, to the making him a miniſter, becauſe the matter of hauing a miniſter, appertayneth properly vnto none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but chiefly and altogeather concerneth them.

The biſhop ſhal lay his hands on none, (ſay they) nor at any other time, but when it ſhall chance that ſome place of miniſtration be voyde in the Dioceſſe. And therefore I conclude, ſince none muſt be made a miniſter, but when it ſhall chance ſome

Firſt for that theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Canons are directly oppoſite, and contrary to the ordinance of almighty God: And the Apoſtles (ſaith the holy ſcripture) <note place="margin">Act. 6.</note> calling the multitude of the diſciples to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, ſayd vnto them, chooſe therefore brethren out from among you, ſeuen men of good report, &amp;c. whom we may appoynt to this buſineſſe: and this ſpeech plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the whole multitude then preſent, and they chooſe Steuen, &amp;c. Which ordinaunce of the Apoſtles whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall thinke, that the ſame may receiue a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buff, by an Angell comming from heauen, much leſſe by a pope comming from the bottomleſſe pit, for my part I hold him accurſed, and ſo vtterly vnworthy the name of a Diſciple. Secondly, the ſayde Canons of <hi>Adryan,</hi> plainely and in flat termes are derogatorie to her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties prerogatiue royall, and therefore by the ſtatute of 25. Henry the 8. vtterly aboliſhed. Thirdly, they are againſt the cuſtomes and ſtatutes of the Realme. For by all the cuſtomes of the Realme, where any Mayor, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe, Shreiffe, or head officer of any Borough, Towne, or any incorporation is to be elected, or where any knight of the ſheire, any Burgeſſe, any Conſtable, any Crowner, any Vergerer within any forreſt, and ſuch like are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, the ſame officers, are alwayes choſen, by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1795:35"/> part of ſuch mens voyces, as haue intereſt in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as touching the ſtatutes of the realme, it is likewiſe euident, that they confirming the booke of king Edward the 6. and the Canons, not preiudiciall to her highneſſe prerogatiue royall, giue vnto the prince, nobilitie, gentry, and other faithfull of the land, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terreſt, in choyce and allowance of their paſtours. And who can be ſo voyd of reaſon or vnderſtanding, as to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that men renewed with the ſpirit of wiſedome, in the Goſpel of Chriſt, ſhould be carefull and diligent, in the choyce of diſcreet and wiſe men, to be dealers for them, in matters pertayning to this tranſitorie life, and yet ſhould be remiſſe &amp; negligent, what guides they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue of, to conduct them in the wayes of eternal life?

The confuſion therefore ſo greatly feared by popiſhe Idolatours, is not once to be ſuſpected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt Chriſtians.

And thus much of the face of the Church, and of the choyce and conſent of the people and Cleargie, to be had in the ordering of miniſters. Touching the Latine tongue required to be in euery miniſter, as the lawes haue alwayes had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to a competent and ſufficient knowledge therin: ſo the Act of Parliament, made the 13. Elizab. cap. 12.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1795:35"/> hath fully and at large expounded the ſame, and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the knowledge thereof in theſe words: [None ſhall be made a Miniſter vnleſſe he be able to aunſwere and render to the ordinary, an account of his Fayth in latine according to the ſayde Articles.] And if any ſhall be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned, contrary to any prouiſion of that Act, then is he no Miniſter at all.]</p>
               <p>And thus as breefly as I coulde, I haue examined theſe wordes, mentioned in the Booke <hi>viz.</hi> calling tryed: examined: knowne: qualities: the face of the Churche; and the Latine tongue, what meaning and ſignification by Lawes in force the ſame wordes haue And alſo what order, and forme our Byſhoppes oughte by Lawe poſitiue to haue vſed, in making Deacons, and Miniſters: and what credite and fidelity, her Highneſſe, and the whole bodie of our Church, and common weal haue repoſed in them, for an orderly, vpright, and ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere diſpoſition of theſe things.

               <p>NEither doth this rule of law: <hi>Multanon ſunt facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, quae tamen facta valent,</hi> anye whit gaine ſaye the truth of this argument. For though it ſeeme probablie by this rule, that a popiſh prieſt beeing once admitted, vnto popiſh prieſthoode ſhould not be remooued: Yet thereby it followeth not, that religion beeing reſtored, and Idolatrie aboliſhed, he coulde not at the firſt reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Goſpell, and entrie of hir gratious raigne, haue beene ſecluded from the office of a miniſter vnder the Goſpell. For what though an Heretique, by the iudgement of an hereticall Synagogue, obtayne the roome of a Sacrificer in the ſame Synagogue, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once obtayned it, may not be remooued from the ſame roome, by the former rule of lawe: Though this be true I ſay, what auayleth it to confirme that a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing prieſt, by vertue of his admiſſion vnto the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, ought to haue a place of miniſtration in the Church of Chriſt? For though he were admitted in the one, yet was he neuer admitted in the other. And therefore it reſteth firme, that they ought not to haue beene admitted then, when as the whole maner of the gouernement of the Synagogue ſhould haue beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. For as at that time their lawes were vnaduiſedly tranſlated from them vnto vs: So by their lawes we might aduiſedly haue transformed them from amongſt vs. They were Schiſmatiques and heretiques by the lawes of our religion, and therefore not to haue beene admitted by the lawes of their owne profeſſion. Yea if they remaine Idolaters ſtill, or keepe backe from the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1795:41"/> people of God the word of God, they are to be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſtill: their ietting vp and downe in their ſquare ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling &amp; white philacteries, or mumbling their mattens &amp; euenſong, are not ſo forcible to keep them in, as their inſufficiencie, negligence, contempt, &amp; idolatrous harts are to thruſt them out. And yet no part of good, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and chriſtian gouernment and pollicie chaunged. For though <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> mooued by compaſſion bening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered the prieſtes of Baal (repenting of their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry) to receiue tithes and offerings with their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Leuites: Yet he ſtreightly charged them not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Lordes ſanctuary to doe any maner of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice there: Neither did this his religious fact, any whit hinder the outward peace of his kingdome. Wherefore if a B. an Abbot, an Archd. an elder, a phiſition, a Iudge, an aduocate, a Iailor, a tutor, a ſchoolmaſter, an Orator, and a philoſopher, by iuſtice and equity of law, for vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, inſufficiencie, negligence, or other defects, ought to be depoſed, and remooued off &amp; from their roomes, places, offices and honours: how ſhould a pretenſed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, onely intruding him ſelf to an office of moſt high calling, &amp; excellency, and vtterly deſtitute of all giftes and graces fit for the ſame, be ſuffered to keepe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the proper right and title of an other, as his owne lawfull poſſeſſion &amp; inheritance. <hi>Had the worſhippers of the falſe Gods, care that their idolatrous priestes, ſhould haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their idoll ſeruice: and ſhall we, the worſhippers of the true God, be blameles before his iudgement ſeat, in caſe we mayntain ſuch to ſerue him in the miniſtery of his holy gospel, as whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, the verieſt Paynymes &amp; idolators woulde refuſe to haue in their idoll temples?</hi>

Though I ſay, theſe former proofes be ſufficient, to confirme theſe aſſertions, yet to make the matter ſomewhat more plaine, I haue thought good, to reexamine the order and forme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted by the former ſtatute, for the making of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and miniſters: that, if vpon examination thereof alſo, there do appeare ſuch a defect by ſtatute lawe, as whereby our dumbe and idoll miniſters, be no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in deede and trueth, but onely in ſhewe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearaunce; that then, therevppon order may be taken by hir maieſtie for the diſplacing of them, and for the placing of other lawfull and godly miniſters in their roomes. For as the ſtatute hath limited a certaine order and forme of making Deacons and miniſters: ſo hath it appoynted, that all that are made according to that order and forme, ſhould be in deed lawful Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and miniſters. The wordes of the ſtatute are theſe. [And that al perſons, that haue beene, or ſhall be made, ordered or conſecrated Archbiſh. biſhop, prieſtes and miniſters of God his holy worde and ſacramentes, or Deacons after the forme and order preſcribed in the ſayde order and forme, how Archbiſh. biſhops, prieſtes, Deacons and minſters ſhoulde be conſecrated, made &amp; ordered, be in very deede, and alſo by authoritie hereof declared and enacted to be and ſhall be, Archbiſhops, prieſtes, miniſters, and Deacons, and rightly made, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and conſecrated, any ſtatute, law, Canon, or other thing to the contrary notwithſtanding.] Which ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute hath two braunches: the one appoynting the forme and maner of making Deacons and miniſters,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1795:42"/> the other authorizing Deacons, and minſters, made, &amp; ordered, after the forme and maner preſcribed in the ſayde booke, to be in very deede, rightly and lawfully Deacons and miniſters, and ſo to be taken and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It followeth then, that if the firſt braunch of the ſtatute be broken, and that the forme and order be not obſerued, that the ſecond braunch can take no place: for that in deede the validitie of the latter, dependeth altogeather vpon the obſeruation of the firſt. For it is plaine and euident by lawe, that if you woulde haue a ſeconde, or latter action to be good, and effectuall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is done (ſay you) according to a forme and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der precedent, you muſt firſt prooue, that the Precedent was accordingly done, or els the conſequent can take no place. And therefore if the forme and order preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the book, be not obſerued in making vnlearned miniſters, I ſay then, that vnlearned miniſters, by lawe, are no miniſters at all.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1795:45"/> that ſithence it hath pleaſed the high Court of Parliament, particularly and expreſly by name, to make choyce of the Archd. &amp; hath perſonally qualified him, as their meeteſt man for this charge, choſing the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of his own perſon in preſenting fit men to be made miniſters, or of his deputies in preſenting fit men to be made Deacons: and for ſo much alſo as in this action, conſiſteth the publike benefit of the whole church, and on the which hangeth the greateſt perill &amp; daunger of the whole church: For theſe cauſes I conclude, that an Archd. onely, muſt &amp; ought of neceſſitie preſent one to the B. to be made a miniſter, &amp; that the B. can not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence with him in this caſe, and that neither the B. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Archd, neither the party to be made a miniſter; neither the clearkes and people preſent, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, can alter or tranſpoſe any thing herin. <note place="margin">ff. de pact. l. ius publicum</note>

As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple: ſuppoſe I haue boght in good faith without colluſion of you, a peece of Plate, for leſſe then the one half of the iuſt value therof, as ſuppoſe for 8.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, which in it ſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth iniquity.

And therfore in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract, being againſt law, appeareth a manifeſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity, becauſe the plate being worth 20. Pounds was ſolde by you for 8. Pound, a leſſe ſum then 10. pound,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1795:48"/> halfe of the iuſt price, and therefore in it ſelfe by law without equitie: and therefore neither to be demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by me, neither to be performed by you. And to make this more playne, and ſo to apply it to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>bona fides</hi> good Fayth, in this contract ought to be in this ſort. You for your part, and I for my part, and we both ought in trueth to think and bee of opinion, that you haue intereſt &amp; right in the plate, and ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to alienate, and to ſell it vnto me. And therefore concerning the contract made betweene the Byſhop and the party, becauſe the Byſhop oftentimes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the partie that is to be made a miniſter by him, to be a man altogether vnlearned, vnfit, and vnapt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his miniſterie duely, and therefore cannot thinke him to be a man quallified as were requiſite: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the partie that is to be made a miniſter, knoweth himſelfe vtterly voide of thoſe graces and gyftes which ought to be in him, and therefore cannot beleeue him ſelfe to bee truely called, or mooued to that office by the holy ghoſt: And becauſe they both know that there hath bene no ſuch calling, no ſuch tryall, no ſuch exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, no ſuch preſentation, &amp;c.

Nowe ſo it is; as I vnderſtand by your demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor euer ſince, that in trueth, you had no other ende, but to ſteale a liuing from the Church, though it were with the murther of many ſoules. You diſhonored the Lorde: you made an open lye in his holy Congregation: you circumuented mee by guyle, and by crafte deluded me: you haue euer ſince falſifyed your worde: You haue not preached one Sermon theſe many yeeres: you haue not inſtructed one of your parriſhe in the doctrine of Saluation by Chriſt alone: you haue not gouerned your familie, as became one of your coate: you haue not exerciſed the Diſcipline of Chriſt againſt any adulterer, any ſwearer, any drunkarde, anye breaker of the Lordes Sabbothes: you haue beene and are a

               <p>If by theſe former concluſions, any ſhall ſurmiſe, that by them I ſlylie, and couertly, as one captious ouer the whole ſtate of the Church, ſhould inſinuate no lawfull miniſterie to bee in England, becauſe ſome one of theſe points perhaps, haue bene &amp; are daylie omitted in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king euen the beſte men that are in the Myniſterie at this daye: I aunſwer, touching as well the whol Church, as the learned and vnlearned miniſter: the preacher, and him that is no preacher: the paſtour and him that is no paſtour: I aunſwere (I ſay) touching them all, as followeth. Firſt, I confeſſe that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath a true Churche, and a faythfull ſpouſe in England, receyuing the doctrines, and Sacramentes of Chriſte, publikely taught and adminiſtred in the Churche of England, wherein we haue ELIZABETH, by the grace of God, Queene of Englande, Fraunce and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, a foueraigne, a ſole, and a lawfull gouerneſſe, in all cauſes, and ouer all perſons, Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall. Moreouer I confeſſe that the doctrines deliuered vnto
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1795:50"/> hir out of the word of God by the miniſters, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing of all and all maner ſuperſtitions and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, retayned in the Church, and for the eſtabliſhing of a perfect gouernement of the ſayde Church, ought to be faithfully embraced, and diligently put in execution by his Maieſtie, according to the preſcript rule of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed worde of God. And againe, that the miniſters ought euermore, in a reuerent and holy feare, to teach what ſo euer they know, to bee commaunded or forbidden by the ſame worde, and to ſhew the daunger as well to the magiſtrate, as to the people, if either or both of them ſhall be negligent, or remiſſe in the Lordes ſeruice. And againe that the people in all holy and honourable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſhould yeeld vnto the magiſtrats, and miniſters, all ſuch loue, reuerence, feare, and obeyſance herein, as the Lord by his ſacred word preſcribeth, and their own ſaluation requireth. Againe, that neither the magiſtrate without true inſtruction from the miniſters: Nor the miniſters without due authoritie from the magiſtrate, ought to wreſt any thing into the gournement of the Church. For both offices, and gouernments, Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and miniſtery are very holy and honourable, &amp; bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeuerall, tend to ſeuerall endes, and bring foorth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall euents in the adminiſtration and gouernment of the Churche: the one is the mouth: the other is the hand of God: the one by worde, the other by ſwoord, ought to execute the Lordes iudgementes in the Lords houſe. The Prophet Eſay at the commandement of the Lord, teaching that the Princes of Iudah and Ieruſalem, ſhould caſt away the rich ornamentes of gold as a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous cloath, did ſtay him ſelfe with the publiſhing of this his doctrine: he onely refourmed him ſelfe, and taught and exhorted others to doe the like. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ieremy vſed onely this weapon of reformation. Of a truth ſayth he, the Lord hath ſent me vnto you, to ſpeake all theſe wordes in your eares: he hath ſent me
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1795:51"/> to prophecie againſt this houſe, and againſt this Citie, al the things that ye haue heard: as for me, behold I am in your handes, do with me as ye think good and right. And though Iehoiakim the king, with all his men of power, the prieſtes and the prophetes ſlewe Vriah with the ſwoorde: yet ceaſed not Ieremiah to ſtande in the Court of the Lordes houſe, to ſpeake vnto all the cities of Iudah, all the wordes that were commaunded him to ſpeake, and kept not a word backe. <note place="margin">2 Kin. 23. 3.</note> When Hilkiah the prieſt had found the booke of the lawe, and cauſed Ioſiah to reade the ſame: it is written that the KING ſtoode by the piller and made a couenant before the Lorde, that he the KING, and the prieſtes, and the prophetes, and all the people both ſmall and greate, ſhould walke after the Lorde, and keepe his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, and his teſtimonies, and his ſtatutes, with all their hearte, and with all their ſoule. And that the KING commaunded Hilkiah the high prieſt, and the prieſtes of the ſeconde order, to bring out of the Temple of the Lorde, all the veſſels that were made for Baall, and for the grooue, and for all the hoſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and that the KING burnt them without Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, in the fieldes of Kidron: and that the KING carryed the powder of them into Bethel: and that HE put downe the Chemerym, and that HE brake downe the houſes of the Sodomites: and that HE brake the images in peeces, &amp;c. When the ſpirite of the Lorde came vpon Azariah, to tell Aſa and all Iudah, and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin, that the Lorde was with him, whileſt they were with him, encouraged them in their affliction, to turne vnto the Lorde God of Iſraell, for that their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and truſt in him, ſhoulde not be fruſtrate, but haue a rewarde: Aſa hearing theſe wordes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, was encouraged, and tooke away all the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, out of the lande of Iudah and Beniamin. And King Aſa depoſed Maachah his mother from hir

                     </gap>.</note> and king Aſa did all theſe thinges at the councell of the Prophet. Neither can the holy doctrine of the Goſpell, be ſayde to be repugnaunt herevnto. God is euer more one, and the ſelfe ſame God in all ages: he is euermore the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of peace and order, not of diſcord, or diſorder. If therefore the Lord, haue not yet gratiouſly opened hir maieſties eyes, to vnderſtand all &amp; ſingular miſteries of his Teſtament: or if he will ſome blemiſh to remaine in the gouernment of a faithfull Queene, vnder the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as it pleaſed him to haue blottes in the raigne of good kings in the time of the law: or if he will that the aduerſaries of Iudah and Beniamyn, hyre counſellers to trouble their building and hinder their deuiſe, all the dayes of Cyrus: or if he will the Temple to be built in the dayes of Eſra the chiefe prieſt, but the walles to be reedified by a Eliaſhib and his brethren: or if he will haue his Church tary his holy leaſure, and appoynted time: or if he haue any other glorious purpoſe to work in our dayes by hir highnes: what is that to him that is a miniſter of the Goſpell? Onely it behooueth him to be a faithfull Steward in his function. For an woe hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ouer his head if he preach not, becauſe neceſſitie is layde vppon him. And let him be aſſured, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is either bounde or looſed by him in earth: the ſame is bounde and looſed by the Lorde in heauen. The repentaunt and faithfull ſhall be forgyuen: The obſtinate and impenitent ſhall bee hardened. And thus hauing deliuered my mynde touching theſe thinges, which otherwiſe by ſyniſter conſtruction, might haue beene daungerous to my ſelfe, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue to others. Touching the former cauill, I anſwere as followeth. Firſt, I confeſſe that euery one meete and apt to teach: that euery one qualified as is requiſit: that euery one mooued inwardly by the holye Ghoſte,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1795:52"/> and outwardly called and appoynted by the biſhop, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing authoritie by the order of this church of England in this behalfe, is in deed &amp; by law, a miniſter. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is indeed &amp; truth a meſſenger, ſent &amp; appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this office by the Lord him ſelfe. Secondly, he is a miniſter by the law of this land. For the ſtate of this man, learned, qualified, and inwardly called: and the ſtate of the vnlearned, &amp; vnqualified, and not inwardly mooued, differ as much as light &amp; darknes. For where the life, the learning, the conuerſation, the paines of the former, doe appeare in deede to be ſincere, ſufficient, honeſt, and diligent, euen ſuch as the law it ſelfe requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſhould be in him, and ſo the ende of the law ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that behalfe, in this caſe, and for this man, there is a preſumption <hi>Iuris &amp; de iure,</hi> of law and by law, that in his outward calling, and triall, &amp;c. all thinges requyred by lawe, were accordingly perfourmed by the biſhop, and ſo he a lawfull miniſter. But touching the other man it is quite contrarie, and therefore this preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by law muſt ceaſe. <note place="margin">Gloſ. extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uag. de pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend cum ſecundum Apoſtolum verdiceat.</note> For where his life, his learning, his conuerſation do appeare manifeſtly to be vile, corrupt, and vnhoneſt, and not ſuch as the law requyreth, and ſo the law fruſtrated, in this caſe there is a preſumption, <hi>Iuris &amp; de iure,</hi> of lawe and by lawe againſt him, that he came to his office <hi>per ſurreptionem,</hi> by ſtealth and vnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly. Letters obtayned for enioying benefices vntill it appeare, they were obtayned, either <hi>veritate tacita,</hi> or <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate expreſſa,</hi> truth concealed or falſehoode expreſſed, are good and to be obeyed: but if afterwardes, either of theſe appeare, they ſhall bee accounted ſurreptiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and voyde. A Bull or diſpenſation from the Pope authentically ſealed, is preſumed to haue beene got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>bona fide,</hi> in good faith: but if in the tenor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appeare falſe latine, it is then preſumed to haue been obtayned <hi>per ſurreptionem.</hi> A ſentence giuen by a iudge is preſumed to be a iuſte iudgement, and euery one for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1795:52"/> the authoritie and reuerence of the Iudge, ought ſo to deeme of the ſame. But in caſe the matter be appealed, and there be found a nullitie in his proceſſe, the former preſumption ceaſeth, and the ſentence as an iniurious ſentence, is to be reuerſed. In like maner, if a Bi. ſhould make an hundreth miniſters in one day, for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and reuerence of the biſhop, and the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I ought to conceiue, of his vpright and ſincere dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, of his holy religion and feruent zeale to the lordes houſe (were I abſent and ſawe not his proceedinges to be contrary to law) as I ought, ſo I truſt I ſhould both eſteeme his doinges therein, to be lawfull and orderly, and alſo reuerence thoſe whom he had ſo made, as meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers ſent from the Lord. But if afterwarde, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſhall come to execute his office of miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: when he came to teach the people, he ſhoulde then manifeſt him ſelfe to be but an Hipocrite, but to haue fayned a certaine kinde of holineſſe and zeale, when he ſhall him ſelfe diſcrie his owne vnablenes, and diſplaye his wantes: were it reaſon that hauing now by mine owne experience, certaine knowledge of his miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and vnhoneſt conuerſation, of his vnaptnes and vnskilfulneſſe, and of his ignoraunce, I ſhould preſume notwithſtanding, that he was at the firſt orderly called and examined, &amp; found to haue ſuch qualities as were requiſite?

Witneſſes at the time of ſigning anye Teſtament commonly reputed freemen, after a controuerſie mooued of their eſtate, maye in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters be refuſed, as vnlawfull witneſſes.

And therefore though <hi>Barbarius Philippus</hi> in that the people decreed vnto him the Pretorſhippe, vvas by the decree made a Freeman, (the people of Roome hauing authoritie to make a Freeman): yet for that he was in deede a ſeruaunt fugitiue from his maiſter, his maiſter was by lawe to haue the price of the ſame his ſeruannt at the peoples handes: muche leſſe can common errour of a fewe in authoritie, or a common errour of a fewe in their owne right, barre the publike wealth, or the Churche from a publike benefite due vnto them.

                  <hi>EX HIIS AVTEM. &amp;c. We ſuffice not to ſpeake, how great euils proceed out of theſe pluralities vnto the church: For by them the honestie of the church is defiled: Authoritie is naught ſet by: the faith of Chriſt is troden vnder foote: loue is baniſhed, the hope of the poore expecting any voyde benefice is frustrate: The miſerable and blind ſinner boasting himſelfe as a guide, doth not ſo much receiue, as ſteale that, that belongeth not vnto him. Among the rich themſelues alſo ſtrifes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions ariſe, braules and enuies are nouriſhed. And for this cauſe we chiefly feare the fire of God his wrath, to haue beene kindled againſt men of ſuch rule, and for the offences of ſome to haue ſent a feare or reuenge againſt all, and whileſt we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo perillous, we feare ſuch or greiuouſer thinges in time to come, vnleſſe God by his mercie respecting vs ſhall lay to ſome wholeſome remedie.</hi> If the diſeaſe and maladie of plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, in time of ignoraunce and ſuperſtition was ſuch, <note place="margin">5. P. 2.</note> that the blinde leaders of the blinde, had their eyes in their heades to ſee the infection ther of to be moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous, as well to their ſynagogue, as to their common weare: how is it poſsible, that plurified men in the time of the knowledge and truth of the Goſpell, ſhould find any meanes, to eſcape the fyre and reuenge which the idolators feared. And not onely theſe Canons and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincials, but the ſtatute lawes of Englande alſo made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe exceſſes, prohibite likewiſe the hauing of mo benefices, as appeareth by an Act of Parliament, made the 21. yeare of Henry the 8. the tenor whereof enſueth. [And be it enacted that if anye perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hauing one benefice with cure of ſoules, beeing of the yearely valew of 8. pound or aboue, accept and take any other with cure of ſoule, and be inſtituted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted in poſſeſsion of the ſame, that then and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after ſuch poſſeſsion had thereof, the firſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſhall be adiudged in the law to be voyd: And that it ſhall be lawfull to euery patron, hauing the aduouſon therof to preſent an other, &amp; the preſented, to haue the

As touching any other Canons made and in force, before 25. Henry 8. allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certayne immunities, priuiledges and diſpenſations to be graunted, for the poſſeſsing of many benefices &amp; parriſh Churches rightly vnderſtood, are no way preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall vnto theſe former ordinaunces. For in thinges depending vpon the meere diſpoſition of man, though the magiſtrate haue authoritie, as well generally to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid and prohibite, as alſo in ſome caſes beſides the ſaid law, to licence and diſpence: Yet concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pluralities, it will not be found. Pluraliſtes (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) and their abettours, ground their aſſertions vpon theſe and ſuch like rules following: viz. <hi>Eius eſt destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere, cuius eſt construere: eius eſt interpretari, cuius eſt condero: Papa qui ius condidie, eſt ſupra ius, maiorem enim retinuit pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem. &amp;c.</hi> That is, To him it belongeth to pul downe, to whom it belongeth to ſet vp: and the interpretation of the lawe, belongeth to the lawe maker: the Pope that made the lawe, is a boue the law, becauſe he hath retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a greater power to himſelfe, then he hath giuen to the law: The pope hath a fulnes of power to diſpoſe of benefices at his pleaſure. And therefore ſay they; As Churches were at the firſt by Law poſitiue, both foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and diſtinguiſhed: ſo may they againe by the ſame lawe poſitiue, either be cleane taken away, or vnited. Which vnneceſſarye and ſophiſticall conſequence, is ſimply to be denyed. Firſt, for thoſe former rules, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vnderſtood without limitation and diſtinction, be either vtterly falſe, or els contrary and repugnant to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1795:60"/> principles of lawe. Againe, concerning theſe or anye other like generall concluſions in lawe, I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere and that by an vnfallible maxime in lawe that no rule, can be ſo generally giuen in thinges of meere pollicie and diſpoſition of man, onelye deuiſed by man, (of which ſort theſe former rules are) that receiueth not ſome limitations and reſtrictions. And that therefore theſe principles, whervpon the foundation of pluralities is layde, beeing weake, and eaſilye ſhaken with a little blaſt of mans witte, can not ſtande or haue anye ſure ſetling, in as much as againſte the ſame, many challenges may be made, and many exceptions taken. Secondly, the foreſayd co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence followeth not, for twoo apparant and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall fallacies contained in the ſame, as afterwardes ſhall be manifeſted. But firſt, touching theſe rules before mentioned; <hi>Eius eſt deſtruere cuius eſt construere, &amp;c.</hi> He may breake a law, that may make a law, the ſame is not alwayes true. It taketh no place, <hi>Vbi cauſa prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis eſt perpetua,</hi> Where there is a perpetuall cauſe of a prohibition: For then the cauſe beeing perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, the prohibition ought to bee perpetuall. <hi>Quia perpetuam habet cauſam prohibitionis, nulla eſt obligatio.</hi> Becauſe it hath a perpetuall cauſe of prohibition, there is no obligation. <note place="margin">ff. de verb. oblig. l. ſi ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puler in id &amp; gloſ. extra de ſimo. c. ſi quis. ver iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramentum.</note> As for example: the reaſon and cauſe of prohibition againſte murther, theft, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, blaſphemy, is perpetuall, and therefore the lawe againſte murther, theft, rauine, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye, ought to be perpetuall: And therefore man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once made lawes againſte theſe vices, it is not lawfull for man afterwardes, to diſpence with theſe vices, or by licence to warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t any man to ſteale, to kill to ſpoyle, or to blaſpheme. For whoſoeuer ſhall in this ſort diſpence with a lawe, the ſame alſo may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the reaſon of the lawe, and ſo with the ſoule and life of the lawe, and ſo make the lawe a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1795:60"/> vayne and dead lawe. <hi>Ratio legis eſt anima legis,</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the law, is the ſoul and life of the Lawe: &amp; therefore as none maye diſpence with the reaſon of the law, or take away the ſoul &amp; life of the law: ſo none may diſpence with the law, or take away the law. Now for as much as it is not lawfull for all the Princes in the earth, to change or diſpence, or take away the reaſons and cauſes of the Lawes prohibiting many benefices: Therefore it is not lawfull for them to chaunge, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, or take away the lawes againſt pluralitites. The reaſons vvherevppon pluralities are forbidden, are reaſons taken from the lawe of nature, and from the equitie of the lawe of God: <note place="margin">Inſtitutio. de iure. nat gen. &amp; ci. § ſed naturali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

For as the lawe of nature is immutable, ſo is the reaſon of the Lawe of nature immutable: and as the vvill of GOD is vnchaungeable, <note place="margin">Iam.</note> ſo is the equitie of his Lawe vnchaungeable to. If then naturall reaſon be the cauſe and ſoule and lyfe of a naturall lawe, and the will of God the onely cauſe of the Lawe of God, and his onely will the rule of all iuſtice vnchangeably, none can challenge authoritie, to change or diſpence with the Law of nature, or with the lawe of God, but hee muſt foorth with challenge authoritie to diſpence both with the reaſon of the Lawe of nature, and with the pleaſure and will of God. And theeefore out of the premiſes I conclude thus.

By which diſcriptions of a Pryueledge and diſpenſation, it is apparant, that a Priueledge and diſpenſation for plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, muſt licenſe and authoriſe that, that the Lawe againſt Plurality doth infringe and diſalow, and ſo be a Lawe contrariant, and repugnaunt to the Lawe againſt Pluralities: but the Lawe againſt Pluralities, is the Lawe of nature and the Lawe of God. Therefore a Priueledge or diſpenſation for Pluralities, is againſt the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1795:62"/> &amp; againſt the lawe of God: a more monſtrous law was neuer eſtabliſhed. Now that pluralities are forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Law of Nature, &amp; by the lawe of God, which was the ſecond Propoſition of my firſt Syllogiſme, I prooue thus. All the reaſons, whereupon the poſitiue Lawe of man againſt Pluralities was firſt eſtabliſhed, are taken and drawne from the Lawe of Nature, and from the Lawe of God: The reaſons and cauſes of the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are theſe: Firſt the auoyding of couetouſneſſe, of Ambition, of Theft, of Murther of Soules, of a Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, a roaging, and a gadding Myniſtery: the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of comlineſſe and decency in the Church, are ſpeciall and primary cauſes for the prohibiting Pluralities: but all theſe are forbidden or commaunded by the Lawe of God: therefore the cauſes of the prohibition of Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, are grounded vppon the will of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immutable, and therefore not to bee diſpenſed with. Againe: for one man to haue the Stipends of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men: for one man not able to diſcharge his duety in one place, and yet to haue many chardges in many places committed vnto him: for one man to hinder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man from ordinary meanes to doe good to the Churche: all theſe cauſes I ſay are ſeconde cauſes for the prohibition of Pluralities: but all theſe cauſes are cauſes of reaſon and nature, therefore by the Lawes of reaſon and nature, Pluralities are forbidden: and therefore not to be diſpenſed with, no more then theft or murder or blaſphemy may be diſpenſed with. And if Antichriſte thinke it Theft, Rauine, Couetouſneſſe, Ambition, Pride, Murder of ſoules, for one man to haue many Benefices without diſpenſation: if Antichriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the hauing of many benefices without diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be a meete meane, to maintain a roauing, a gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and a diſſolute Miniſtery: to foſter extortion and vnlawfull gaine: what ſhall the ſeruauntes of the Lorde Chriſte, the ſonne of the moſt higheſt, <hi>whom he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

For, though a Diſpenſation be but a fiction in law: yet is that fiction indeede, of as greate force and efficacie in that feyned caſe, and worketh as great effect, as the trueth of the Lawe it ſelfe in a caſe of trueth: <note place="margin">Cod. de coll. dec. l. liberos</note> And by Lawe it is all one in effect, whether I enioy anye Benefite by priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or by common right.

               <p>The ſecond fallacy wherein plurality men beguile themſelues, is as euident and palpable as the firſt. They reaſon thus. Churches were eſtabliſhed, and pariſhes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by man: therefore Churches and Pariſhes may be vnited by man: and if Churches may be vnited by man, then one man may haue many Benefices. The Antecedent of which Enthimeme is ſophiſticall, becauſe of the double and trebble ſignification of the worde Churches, and therfore the argument limpeth after the ſame manner, as the former did, attributing the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of Churches, to man onely: for if they ſhould mean by this worde (Churches) frames of Churches, faſhioned of Timber, Wood, Stone, Morter and ſuch like, then ſay they truely, that Churches were builded and founded by man: as to ſaye by Maſons, Carpentors, Tylars, &amp;c. But they will not haue the name of (Churches) in their Argument to be taken in this ſence. Their meaning (I am ſure) is not ſo, they haue no ſuch intent: for ſo might they rather burthen themſelues with the reparations of many Churches, then profit themſelues, with the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of many Churches: And by being Lordes of many Steeples after that ſort, they might gape long ynough vpon them, before they gayned ought by them. If they meane by this worde (Churches) congregations and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles of people, then is their aſſertion abſolutely falſ, becauſe the Lorde hath willed all his people, to gather &amp; aſſemble themſelues together, to the intent they ſhoulde call vpon his name: And then in this ſenſe their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

But Churches againe taken &amp; vnderſtood in this ſence, as they make not for their purpoſe one way: ſo are they not curraunte to themſelues and their ſences an other way. They woulde teache and preache little inough, and bee wearie of well doinge ſoone inough: had they not reſpect to greaſe themſelues, rather with the fatte of the labour of the people, then diligently to gouerne and inſtruct the people: And therefore I geſſe their meaning to be, that Churches in their former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſhoulde ſignifie the liuings of Churches, and therefore their argument to be thus in effect. Liuinges of Churches are eſtabliſhed and diſtinguiſhed by man: therefore liuings of Churches may bee taken away, or vnited by man; wherein they attribute ſtill to man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that, that in no wiſe appertayneth to man alone: for as Congregations are appointed by the Lorde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo are paſtors ouer Congregations, and liuings for paſtours likewiſe appoynted by him. And therefore as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations of the Lords people cannot be altogether diſſolued by man alone, ſo ought not the liuinges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for the paſtours of the ſame people to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by man alone. Doe yee not knowe (ſayth the apoſtle) <note place="margin">Cor. 1. 9 13.</note> that they which miniſter about the holy things, eate of the things of the Temple: &amp; they which waite at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar? So alſo hath the lord ordeined, that they which preach the goſpel, ſhold liue of the Goſpell. And therfore, in ſaying that liuings of Churches &amp; parriſhes, are diſtinguiſhed by man, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may be vnited by man, though in ſome ſence the ſame may be true; yet thereby it followeth not, that many liuings appoynted by the Lorde himſelfe for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſtors ouer many Congregations, ſhoulde be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many &amp; be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to one.

As our aunceſters in times paſt, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and limitting pariſhes, haue inlarged ſome with wyder borders, and ſtraightened ſome with narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er paſſages then was meete and conuenient: So were it very good and commendable for men of wiſedome in our dayes; to yeelde to haue a better equallitie, then that ſome ſhould haue al, and ſome neuer a whit: ſome two or three thouſand pounds by the yeare; and ſome ſcarcely xx. Nobles, ſo that the paſtor that now hath too little, might by ſome meanes haue ſufficient: and that he that hath now too much, might haue a conuenient competencie.

               <p>THE Minor propoſition of which Syllogiſme, to euerye man, not minded to cauill at theſe wordes, (Eſtabliſhed and diſtinguiſhed) is infallible, and not to bee denyed: for though boundes and lymittes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne parriſhes, are bordered out by man: and that a certayne number of people, called to make one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and to heare at one time, in one place, one certayne paſtour, bee at the rule and diſpoſition of man: yet that theſe thinges ſhoulde be thus done, is the ſpeciall commaundement of the Lord. Moreouer when as this thing ſhalbe once thus performed by man (accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to the Lords commaundement) it ſhalbe &amp; is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1795:65"/> for man again, where the congregation is too great to make the ſame leſſe, and where it is too litle, to make the ſame greater: and in this ſence I graunt, that as it is lawful for man to eſtabliſh &amp; diſtinguiſh: ſo it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for man, to take away and to vnite Churches and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings. But becauſe this is not the meaning of pluraliſts, for that they wil haue one paſtor, to be placed ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations, &amp; many congregations to finde one paſtor: many bodies to haue one head: &amp; one head to haue many bodies: many flocks to haue one ſhepheard, &amp; one ſheepheard to haue manie flocks: Therfore mine argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without any cauil, remaineth firm againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

For, though by coullor of lawe, they pretend right vnto them: yet the law indeed yeeldeth them no ſuch aduantage, becauſe diſpenſations for many benefices and pariſh Churches, with cure of ſoules generally graunted, are, and ought by law to be vtterly voide and of none effecte, as partly hath bin prooued, and more at large appeareth by that that followeth. <note place="margin">Gloſ. 1. q. 7. c. requiritis.</note>

               <p>THe Minor propoſition of the firſt ſyllogiſme, hath beene already ſufficiently prooued by manye in fallible concluſions of Lawe, and vndoubted truethes of the worde of God, and therefore it is needeleſſe to make any repetition thereof. Onely I would haue the reader diligently to marke the wordes of the Statute, forbidding all manner of Diſpenſations, in any matter or cauſe, repugnant to the worde of God. For though the aduerſary cauill, that we finde not in the ſcriptures theſe Termes: Viz. Licenſes, Tollerations, Diſpenſations, &amp;c. preciſely ſpecified in any commaundement, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitory in the Scriptures: Yet in as much as the matter or cauſe of Diſpenſations for many benefices, is there generally forbidden: as ambition, pride, couetouſnes, perill of ſoules, &amp;c. <note place="margin">It is againſt the peace &amp; profit of the common weale, that the Archb. ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</note> Therefore it followeth, that by this ſtatute Diſpenſations in this caſe are abſolutely inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. The minor propoſition of the ſecond Syllogiſm, may be confirmed by three euident reaſons. Firſt from the euent, which by our owne common and daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, we too too well knowe to be true. For by the ſame we ſee a fewe wealthy and ritch Prelates, in pride &amp; iolity to be maintained, and a great number of nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Stipendary Curates and poore Miniſters, to be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute of meete and conuenient allowaunces; ſo that ſometimes after theire diſſeaſe, their diſtreſſed wiues and Children, are forced eyther to bee releeued by the ſeuerall Pariſhes of their aboades, to the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueriſhing of the ſame pariſhes: or elſe conſtrained to beg from place to place, &amp; ſo be chaſtiſed as rogues; or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1795:70"/> pilfer &amp; ſteal, and ſo be puniſhed as fellons. Secondly, by a compariſon drawn from other Statutes of the realme, prouiding that one rich and mighty man, ſhoulde not exerciſe many ſeueral miſteries, trades and faculties, and ſo rob the poorer ſort from the ordinary meanes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might liue well and honeſtly in the common wealth. The third reaſon is taken, from an adiunct or common accident to euery common weal, rightly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned: that is, that the laſt Willes and Teſtamentes of all and ſingular teſtators, be duely execued, eſpeciallye ſuch, as whereby the honour of God is promoted, the Church and common weale manifeſtly regarded: but vnto the performaunce of the the laſt Willes and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of many patrons endowing many churches with large and ample poſſesſions, to the intent conuenient liuinge might be alwayes prouided for Paſtors to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaunt, and to feede their poſterity with the foode of life, the worde of God: there can be nothing more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall, or more derogatory, then that theſe ſeuerall patrimonies and inheritaunces, appointed by ſeuerall patrons, for ſeuerall Paſtors, to ſuch ſeuerall and good vſes, ſhoulde by the diſpenſation of one man, be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and giuen to another vſe, contrary to the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor his intent and purpoſe. And therefore I confirme my Minor Propoſition by theſe three concluſions.
<list>
                     <item>1 Whatſoeuer is an occaſion that poore and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Miniſters, their wiues and children do want a competent &amp; conuenient maintainance, the ſame is not neceſſary, for the profite, peace, wealth, and conſeruation of the common weale:</item>

                  <note place="margin">It is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for the honor &amp; ſafety of her highneſſe perſon, for the Archb. to diſpence.</note> COncerning the validitye of the Minor propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my third ſyllogiſme; drawne from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie of her highneſſe honor (namely that it is not conuenient, for the honour and ſuerty of her Highnes perſon, to leaue any manner of authority, for the Archb. to diſpence) none may wel doubt therof, but only ſuch as reſpect more the pomp and glory of an Archb. then the dignity &amp; preeminence of a Chriſtian King. For in good ſoth, this ſtatute made principally to aboliſh al v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped power, challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged by a forre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Romiſh pope, ouer
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1795:71"/> the king &amp; his ſubiects, &amp; yet to authoriſe a domeſtical &amp; Engliſh Archb. in his roome, containeth in it, ſuch a contrariety, &amp; ſuch an abſurdity, as it is wonder how ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Archb. durſt challenge the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof, or elſe how hir highneſſe moſt noble Father, &amp; brother, &amp; her highnes own perſon, could endure the ſame ſo long vncanſelled &amp; vnrepealed, eſpeciallye the ſame being moſt preiudiciall to their regall crownes and dignities. For firſt, by the vertue of this Statute, it is enioyned the Archb. and his ſucceſſours in no manner wiſe, to graunt any diſpenſation, licence, reſcript, or any other writing for anye cauſe or matter, repugnaunt to the lawe of Almighty God. Secondly, it is permitted vnto the ſayde Archbyſh. and his ſucceſſours, by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions to graunt vnto the K. Maieſtie, and to his heires and ſucceſſours, Kings of this Realme, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſuch licenſes. &amp;c. as heretofore haue beene accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee had and obtayned by his Highneſſe, or any his Noble Progenitors, or any his ſubiectes at the ſea of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which two clauſes, without diſhonour to the Maieſty of God, or preiudice to her highneſſe preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, cannot poſſible eſtabliſh a ſound and perfect Lawe. For, firſt in as much as the popes perſon, was neuer duly qualified to be a Lawfull diſpenſor, or any lawfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in the Church of God, it is manifeſt that euery diſpenſation granted at that time at the ſea of <hi>Rome,</hi> was directly againſt the Lawe of God, as graunted by one that was no member of the Church of God. Again: In as much as the trueth of the Goſpell warranteth vs, that ſymony, Vſury, Periury, Adultery, Inceſt, Nonre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency, many benefices, Marriages againſt the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law: obſeruations of ſuperſtitious dayes and times, not eating of fleſh in Lent, and ſuch like, are againſt the Lawe of God: it is euident that diſpenſations graunted at that time, for theſe and ſuch like things, at the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> were granted in cauſes and matters repugnant to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1795:71"/> the law of God, and ſo by the former braunch of this ſtatute being preciſely diſſalowed, cannot by the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d branch, of the ſame be generally approoued. For how can one &amp; the ſelf ſame law, forbid and comand, things ſo contrary and repugnant in themſelues? Or how can the Archbiſhop ſafely ground his iuriſdiction vppon a lawe ſo contrary and repugnaunt vnto it ſelfe? If the Archbyſhop ſhall think that theſe two braunches may be reconciled, &amp; that the meaning of the former maye and ought ſimply to be vnderſtood, as the words them ſelues import: and that the ſecond braunch, may and ought to be vnderſtoode, to bound and limite ſuch an authoritie to him ſelfe, as whereby he might graunt ſuch licenſes, as were had and obtayned at that time, at the ſea of Rome, for matters not contrary or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the law of God: yet neither by this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the Archbiſhop truely intituled vnto any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, therby to diſpence for ſymony, nonreſidence, many benefices, marriages in Lent, &amp;c. in as much, as ſuch maner of licenſes obtayned at that time at the ſea of Rome, were obtayned for matters repugnaunt vnto the law of God, and contrary to the truth of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Goſpell: and ſo by this ſtatute flatly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. Which thinges our aunceſtors, not thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſeeing, neither duely examining for what maner of cauſes or matters, licenſes were at that time obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the ſea of Rome: but onely in a generallitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting thinges repugnaunt vnto the law of God, and neuer particularly deſcribing what thoſe things were: but leauing the ſame wholy to the iudgement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of one man the Archbiſhop alone, haue fallen into two palpable abſurdities: the one, that one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, hath from time to time authoritie by his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to determine what cauſes are repugnaunt to the holy ſcriptures and lawes of God: what cauſes &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are conuenient for the honour and ſafety of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1795:72"/> King of England, and what are neceſſary to be had for the wealth and profite of the realme, three thinges of ſuch waight and importaunce, as the whole body of the realme at that time, was ſcarceable to conceiue, much leſſe ſhall euer any one Archbiſh. be able to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize. The other abſurditie is this, viz. that by this ſtatute, ſoueraignity is giuen to the Archbiſhop and his ſucceſſors to diſpence with the king, and his ſucceſſors, kinges and Queenes of Englande. The wordes of the ſtatute are plaine and euident. But what reaſon is there for kinges and queenes of England, to become wardes and pupils vnto an Archbiſhop of England? Or howe agreeth it, with the worde of God, that a Chriſtian king, ſhould in any ſort, be in ſubiection vnto his owne vaſſall? Or what chriſtian ſubiect, dareth attempt to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto his Chriſtian ſoueraigne a tolleration? For in caſe, the matter of the ſayde tolleration be pretended to concerne the conſcience, then if the matter be free and lawfull by the law of God, a Chriſtian king, may as well and as freely, vſe the liberty of his conſcience, with out licence from his ſubiect, as his ſubiect maye vſe his freedome, without diſpenſation from the king. If it be contrary to the lawe of God, then may neither a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian king, neither a Chriſtian ſubiecte be diſpenced with. For what man can diſpence with the Lawe of God? And in caſe the matter of diſpenſation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne any thing appertayning vnto this life, how then ſhould the king receiue a diſpenſation from the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, without impeaching his kingly dignitie and prerogatiue? For either he muſt bee diſpenced with, for breach of the poſitiue Lawe of this lande, and haue the payne of Lawe, remitted him by the Archbiſhop, which were to ſet the Archbiſhops keyes, aboue the Kinges armes: Or els he muſte purchaſe a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he may breake his Lawe, which were againſt his honour and ſafety. For ſaith the Emperour. <hi>Digna

               <p>Moreouer, this caſe between the king and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop is farre different, from the caſe betweene the king and his Iuſtices at lawe, determining matters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common lawes and cuſtomes of the Realme, betweene the king and his ſubiectes. For they remayne ſtill the kinges vnderlinges, and in deed giue but the kinges iudgements; they iudge not the kinges perſon, neither commeth any thing touching his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before them. But diſpenſations from the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to the king, concerne the kinges owne perſon. The king in his royall perſon, or by his proctor, muſte appeare in the Archbiſhops conſiſtory: he muſt alleage before the Archbiſhop ſufficient matter, whervpon the Archbiſhop (but a ſubiect) may be mooued to diſpence with the King, his ſoueraigne; and finally the Kinges wiſedome muſte be ſubiected, to the Archbiſhops diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.

The Church that by negligence of any Proctor or Sollyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhall alleage her ſelfe, by his negligence to bee hurt, &amp; to ſuffer loſſe in hir ſubſtaunce, and for that cauſe ſeeketh helpe at the handes of her ſuperiour, to be reſtored to her former eſtate, muſt prooue as well the negligence committed, as the dammage ſuſtained in that behalfe. The like is verified of one that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of his goodes, in the time of his abſence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas. And ſo it is required in graunting any priuelege immunitie or diſpenſation for many benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

And this proofe that it be ſubſtanciall and good in Lawe, muſt be made either by the confesſion of the party, eyther by witneſſes, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome Authentike and publique inſtrumente, eyther by the euidence &amp; notoriouſnes of the fact it ſelfe. <note place="margin">Extra. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitu. ſpol c. cum ad ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> Touching which proofes, howe ſubſtantially they haue beene made; I referre the Reader to the Records of the Prerogatiue Court, where, no doubt for the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges owne credite, they are ſafely kept: and as publique Recordes, to be ſeene of any man, deſirous to knowe Antiquities. For my part, though I confeſſe that the dignity and worthineſſe of a perſon to be priueleged, may eaſily be prooued, yet can I not imagine, by which of theſe proofes, the cauſes required by Law, as vrgent necesſity, and euident vtility of the Church, deſtitute
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1795:82"/> of a Paſtor, ſhoulde in theſe our dayes be manifeſted: the Church it ſelfe Viz. The congregation, (I ſuppoſe) will neuer confeſſe it behoouefull for them to haue their paſtor abſent, and to giue their temporall things, to enioy ſpirituall thinges, and yet to be depriued of both ſpirituall and temporall. As concerning proofe by Witneſſes, or by publique inſtrument, becauſe Witneſſes muſt yeelde a reaſon of their ſayings, and a publique Inſtrument ought to be made, by a fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, at the requeſt of the party: and becauſe no witneſſe can yeelde any reaſon, why his neyghboure ſhoulde not be taught, and euery Faythfull man will doe all things for the trueth, and nothing againſt the trueth: and becauſe the truethe is, that his Neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhould be taught, and no man will deſire to bee vntaught: therefore as concerning theſe proofes, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine (I ſay) how they ſhould be made. It reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth then, that the euidence of the fact, muſt bee the proofe, whereon plurified men relie, that the vrgent necesſity, and euident vtility of the Church, for the hauing of many benefices, is a thing ſo notorious and euident to all the worlde, that none may denye the ſame. Wherein howe groſſe and palpable their erroure is, I leaue to the conſideration of indifferent men, thorow out the whole world. Now, if you ad this laſt part of the definition of a Diſpenſation, &amp; ſuppoſe that it muſt be granted, <hi>Cum cauſae cognitione,</hi> with know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of the cauſe, that is by alleadging and proouing things iuſt and equall in the ſight &amp; iudgement of the Parliament houſe, you ſhal find either all, or the moſt part of diſpenſations granted in the Court of faculties for many benefices, not to be the things defined, &amp; ſo to be nothing in effect at all, and therfore though they as yet ſeeme to ſtande good by Lawe, yet to be ſuch as ought to bee reuoked and made voyde by Lawe. <note place="margin">Diſtinct. 10. c. vides.</note>

What man though his Houſe be ample and very rich, doth pay to his ſeruaunt abſenting himſelf, the wages due to many ſeruauntes: or admitteth to ſerue in his roome, whom ſoeuer the ſame his ſeruaunt ſhall appoynt him in his roome: onely the houſe of God, the holy Church, is by ſuch inordinary dealing depriued of her miniſtery, and defrauded of her lawfull duties.

For, were the party committing Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, for the ſame offence by lawe depriued from his benefice, her highneſſe were then to haue of the next incumbent, the whole firſt Fruites of the ſaid benefice, euen ten times ſo much at the leaſt, as is paid into her hanapire: Or were the Symoniacall perſon a plurality man, and ſo depriued from all his benefices and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical promotions, her highneſſe were then to haue, the whole firſt Fruites of all his Benefices and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, fortye times ſo much as ſhee enioyeth by graunting his diſpenſation. And as touching the fees due for Diſpenſations, graunted for many Benefices, though the ſame fees may happilye amount in ſome one yeare, too many hundreds: yet by meanes of the ſayde Diſpenſations, her highneſſe is impoueriſhed yeerely by many thouſands. The oftener euerye bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or promotion is voyde, by death, reſignation or depriuation, the oftener is another admitted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame, and the oftener doth her highneſſe receiue the firſt Fruites of any ſuch benefice. Now, it is euident that the conioyning of two, three, foure or
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1795:84"/> fiue thouſand benefices or promotions vnto one thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſand men by diſpenſations, is a manifeſt impediment to the auoiding of ſo many incumbents from ſo many benefices, as which by death, reſignation or depriuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſaid incumbents, might &amp; were likely to be made voyde. And ſo the ſaide diſpenſations, being an hinderance to the auoiding of benefices, they muſt neceſſarily be alſo a very direct meanes, to keepe from her exchequer that treaſure, that otherwiſe ſhould or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily be brought vnto it. And though by the death, reſignation, or depriuation of euery plurality man, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his benefices be made void: Yet his ſaid benefices are not ſo often made voyde, as otherwiſe they ſhould be. And therefore though her highneſſe haue the firſt fruits of two, three, foure or fiue benefices in the hands of one pluralitye man, dying, reſigning, or beeing depriued: Yet hath ſhe not the firſt fruites of the ſayde benefice ſo often as otherwiſe ſhe might haue, wherby her reuenewes are leſſened. Since therefore, for one man to enioy many benefices by diſpenſation, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth couetouſneſſe, and is contrary to the ancient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons: mainteineth ambition, and miniſtreth matter for a roaging a gadding, and a diſſolute myniſtery: ſince it conuayeth ſtipends due vnto many, from many vnto one: Since it is an hinderance of reſidence, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth peril of ſoules: Since it is a kind of theft, rauine &amp; ſpoil: Since it is vndecent and vncomly: Since it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the good cuſtomes of the Church: Since the honeſty of the church thereby is defiled, the authority thereof contemned: the trueth of Chriſt troden vnder foote, &amp; loue baniſhed: Since among the rich Prelates and plurified men them ſelues, ſtrifes, contentions, brawles and enuies ariſe, and are nouriſhed: Since the fire of God his wrath is kindled againſt vs by them: ſince it is againſt the law of nature, and repugnant to the law of God, and therefore nouriſheth a Monſter in

The pope reſeruing a power vnto him ſelfe (as he ſayth) aboue his law, hath power to breake euery of his lawes, and ſo hath no law but his will, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him ſelfe a God on earth, hath made prouiſions, that both this law, touching the not exerciſing of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall diſcipline by one man alone, and the lawes of non reſidency, and the not hauing of many benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be in truth no lawes at all, and ſo in effect hath allowed a monſter, and a contrarietie in nature, that one member ſhould be all the members: and that the head ſhould be the whole body. And what haue they done els, that haue maintained by publike wrytinges, the like proceedinges now a dayes to be lawfull? For though they haue beene no Popes them ſelues: Yet

Well then, as theſe lawes haue been made to rule and gouerne the Church by, ſo theſe lawes haue beene a long time vnmade, to vnrule and vngo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne by, and that not without coullour of law to: As firſt by way of priuiledge: ſecondly, by meanes of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and long vſage. To ſpeake in this place of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges graunted to this effect were ſuperfluous, and very impertinent. <note place="margin">Cuſtome the ground of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and not the law.</note> For though our biſhops may haue remayning in their old recordes, priuiledges from the Pope, to giue them immunities in this behalfe, yet for two reſpects, I ſuppoſe they will conceale, rather then reueale them.

If we in theſe dayes had the like multitude of Church matters to be diſpatched as the papiſtes had, &amp; that the Cleargy now, were loden with the like bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, as at the time of theſe ordinaunces they were,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1795:88"/> there might be then ſome ſhew of reaſon, that the ſame cuſtome for the ſame cauſe, ſhould ſtill remaine. Many Monaſteries, Priores, Frieries, Nunneries, and other ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious houſes vnder the iuriſdiction of popiſh bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, had many buſineſſes &amp; many blind matters to be decided. It was comberſome for euery baudy matter of a frier, and a Nun, to call a Chapter: it was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for placing or diſplacing euery Abbot, frier, Nun, Dean, prebend, parſon, vicar, or any other of the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to call a Chapter. In our churches (God be praiſed) we haue no ſuch tumultuous Cleargy, continually to trouble the chapter: we haue no ſuch number of bad matters as they had. And therefore the cauſe in this reſpect ceaſsing, the effect alſo might right well ceaſe. Moreouer the common and vſuall diſſention amongeſt them, were ſpeciall meanes that elections, inſtitutions, confirmations, collations, and ſuch like, were hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Many fruſtratory appeales and other delaies made and long ſuites commenſed. But our Cleargie are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtructed in the wayes of the Lord: they teach the people peace, and exhort them to brotherly amity and loue, and therfore it is to be coniectured, that cauſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt peaceable men, wold ſpeedely and peaceably be ended: and therefore in this reſpect alſo, the cauſe cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the effect ſhoulde ceaſe. Laſtly, the caſe ſtandeth not now with vs at this time, as it did then betweene the biſhop and the Chapter. The law written then was, that the biſhop and Chapter ſhoulde excommunicate, &amp;c. <hi>Quia firmius eſt iudicium quòd plurimorum ſententia confirmat.</hi> Becauſe a iudgement confirmed with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many is more ſtrong. The reaſon of the cuſtome for the Bi. without the Chapter was this, <hi>Vt facilius ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediantur negotia,</hi> That buſineſſe might more eaſely be finiſhed. In which caſes you ſe the matter to ſtande whollye betweene the biſhop and the Chapter: As whether the biſhop with the Chapter, or without the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1795:89"/> Chapter for the foreſayde ſeuerall reaſons, might haue the rule and gouernement in Church matters? To the which demand I anſwere thus. If the controuerſie were betweene the Biſhop of London, and the Deane and Chapter of Paules, whether a ſentence of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation denounced by the biſhop alone againſt any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons contumacie, within the Dioceſſe of London, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aduiſe of the Dean and Chapter, were good &amp; forcible in law, and that the biſhop were able by proof in law, to confirme, that time out of mind and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of man, he and his predeceſſors biſhops of London, without contradiction of the Dean and Chapter vſed, whenſoeuer oportunity ſerued, to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate alone, without the preſence of the Dean and Chapter: I ſaye that in this caſe by Canon law, a ſentence giuen by the biſhop alone, were good, and not reuerſible, by meanes of the Dean &amp; Chapters abſence. For that herein now they haue willingly loſt their owne right, and depriued themſelues of their intereſt. For the biſhop alwayes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſentence in the Chapter houſe, where the Dean &amp; Chapter might continually be preſent and haue their aduiſe, they voluntarily abſenting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vnto himſelfe this iuriſdiction, whervnto they haue alſo yeelded, by giuing their ſecret conſent, that the B. alone ſhould execute thoſe things wherin they had an intereſt, and which otherwiſe he might not haue don. In like maner, if the Archdeacon ſhould make the lyke aſſertion againſt the Biſh. to prooue and inſynuate wils and Teſtaments, and were able to prooue the ſame his aſſertion: I would conſult, that he likewiſe by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non law had right herein againſt the B. For in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Biſhop, and the Archdeacon are in place of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men, the Dean and Chapter hath the roome of a priuat man, becauſe, were the matter in controuerſie to bee decyded betweene them, they were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence their Actions before ſuperiour Magiſtrates.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1795:89"/> But the matter of Excommunication mentioned by the Lawe written, and of right Excommunication in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, is not of this nature: it is not of the nature of a priuate action, betweene man and man, nor of ſuite commenced betweene party and party, but the caſe herein ſtandeth betweene a meane perſon, or a meere periuate man, and the whole Church: yea betweene the Lorde of Heauen and earth, and a Byſhop his pore creature: It is not (I ſay) whether the ſame ſhould bee executed by man onely, becauſe <hi>Firmius eſt iudicium, quod plurimorum ſententia confirmatur,</hi> or by fewe <hi>vt faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius expedirentur negotia,</hi> But whether the ſame ſhould be executed onely by many, and not by one, becauſe the ordinaunce of God is ſo. And therefore the caſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in effect thus, whether a lawfull preſcription by an Archbyſh. or Byſhop, agaynſt a Deane and Chapter, or the cuſtome of an Archdeacon, againſt Archbyſh. Byſh. and Deane and Chapter by the Canon Lawe, be a ſound, &amp; ſubſtantiall preſcription and cuſtome, againſt the whole Church, againſt the family of the Lord, and againſt his ordinance. For at the beginning it was not ſo. Whereunto I aunſwere, that as <hi>Nullum tempus currit Regi, nullum tempus currit reipub.</hi> No time runneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, no time runneth againſt the common wealth: ſo in this caſe, and all other of the like nature, <hi>Nullum tempus currit eceleſiae, nullum tempus currit domino.</hi> No time runneth the Church, and no time runneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lorde. And therefore, though the Byſhop may perhaps affirme, him ſelfe to haue obtayned right by preſcription, to excommunicate without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the Deane and Chapter: yet ſhall he neuer be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prooue, that hee hath therefore lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to excommunicate alone, ſithence the vſadge of the firſt Church, and the ordinaunce of the Lorde are quite and cleane agaynſt his ſayde aſſertion. Yea, I ſay more, namely, that euen by the Canon Law it ſelfe,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1795:90"/> neither Archb. nor B. can truely iuſtifie any Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by one man alone at all: the ſaid popiſh cuſtom now ceaſing, to be any more a cuſtome. For, in deed the reaſon of this cuſtome ceaſeth to be any more a reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſuch a cuſtom in our time: &amp; the reaſon of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer lawes, made before this cuſtome, vrgeth the ſame lawes to be practized again now a dayes. And therfore as <hi>Ceſſante cauſa, ceſſare debet effectus,</hi> the cauſe ceaſing, the effect ought to ceaſe: &amp; <hi>vrgente ratione legis, vrgenda eſt lex,</hi> The reaſon of the Law vrging, the Lawe is to be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: So the ſayde popiſhe cuſtome ought in deede to ceaſe, and the ſayde Canon Lawes ought to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. Neyther is the Canon of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eyght, made for the ſayd cuſtome, any impediment hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Firſt, for that the ſaide cuſtome, is meerely againſt the worde of God: with which no Pope coulde euer diſpence. And therefore, as contrary to the Apologie of the fayth of the Church of England, by no intende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any ſtatute, or ſtatute makers in England con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. Secondly, the Canon of <hi>Boniface</hi> made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme a cuſtom; not participating the nature, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and inſeparable accidents of euerie good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cuſtome, but onely made by a lawles &amp; abſolute power, contrary to the principles and axioms of Law, is not confirmed by the ſtatute of 25. vnleſſe wee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly graunt, eyther the ſaid ſtatute to confirme law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Canons, and a law leſſe cuſtome: or ſeuerally to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh a lawleſſe cuſtome, and to infringe lawfull Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. For this decree of <hi>Boniface,</hi> approoueth and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth ſuch a cuſtome, as hath no maner of fellowſhip or ſocietie with any lawfull cuſtom. But to let theſe things paſſe, and no further to vrge the defecte of the reaſon of the cuſtome, to aboliſh the cuſtome, or the efficacie of the reaſons of the Law, to eſtabliſhe againe the law: Let vs returne to the lawes and decrees before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, authoriſing cuſtom to binde as effectually as a law:
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1795:90"/> and by them let vs, ſee whether this cuſtome, (that one ſhoulde excommunicate alone) authorized by <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. participate the nature and proprieties of euery ſuch cuſtome, as whereof mention is made in the lawes and decrees; and if not, then let vs conclude the ſame to be no cuſtome at all: <note place="margin">Euery vſage is not a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</note> &amp; if no cuſtome, then no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of excommunication, either by lawe or cuſtome to be vſed at all. For euery vſe creptin &amp; continued ſome long ſpace, is not therefore by and by a cuſtom, &amp; ſo of the nature of a law, and of ſuch power as foorthwith it may ſholder out written law, &amp; control co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon right. <note place="margin">ff. de conſti. princi. l. in rebus.

For if the ſame ſhalbe erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, vnreaſonable, &amp; not lawfully preſcribed, then is it of ſufficient force to expel the law writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; therfore as hurtfull and preiudiciall for the gouernment of the church here after to be abrogated, &amp; aboliſhed. For cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is no more priueledged then a lawe: but as a law may be made dead, &amp; taken away by a cuſtome: ſo like wiſe may a cuſtome, be made dead again by reuiuing a former law. And though here might be vſed a peremp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tory chalenge againſt this cuſtom begun &amp; continued in the popiſhe Synagogue, contrary to the cuſtome of the Church of Chriſt, that for that cauſe, &amp; in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect only, the ſame is farre vnmeet for vs, &amp; therfore by vs to be vtterly abandoned: Yet becauſe we are as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1795:91"/> yet (I can not tell how) not altogether freed from the lawes and cuſtomes of the popiſh ſynagogue, Let vs vſe the reaſon of the ſame lawes to ouerthrow the ſame cuſtome. Neyther yet ſhoulde any man thinke, that therefore the former popiſh lawes, are to be approued as meete lawes, for the Church of Chriſt, to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by. For weare there no other grounde of trueth, that one ſhoulde not Excommunicate alone, but the reaſon of the Popiſh law, the obſeruation therof wold not be vrged. But becauſe wee haue the trueth it ſelfe confirmed vnto vs, at the commandement of the Lord by the Apoſtles mouth, practiſed by the moſte aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers, and by their authority and example drawn into the popiſh Synagogue, vntill the year of our Lord, 1295. (as the Canons before mencioned doe witneſſe) for this cauſe, and in this reſpect onely, are theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer lawes to be put in execution, and the former cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is to be abrogated. The lawes woulde bee kept becauſe in effect they containe the purity of the truth: the cuſtome woulde be left, becauſe the ſame degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth, from the ſimplicity and practiſe of the former times, and is but a meere corruption, and a lawleſſe deuiſe of a lawleſſe Pope, <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight. And that euery one may be well and thoroughly inſtructed, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reaſons of the lawes following, to ouerthrow the former cuſtome, hee is diligently to conſider, that as the Papiſtical ſynagogue always faſhioned &amp; framed her ſelfe, in obedience to her King, his lawes, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more liked that, that her King liked, and miſliked that, that he miſliked: ſo the congregation of Chriſte, hath alwayes humbled herſelfe vnto the will and pleaſure, of her Lorde and King Chriſte, ſhe hath conſented to that onely, that hath beene pleaſaunt in his ſight, and hath diſſented from whatſoeuer was diſpleaſing vnto him: euery one ought to conſider, that the Popes cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, are not the Lordes people: their errours cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1795:91"/> with our trueth: their ignorance with our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: their furie with our peace: their deuill with our God: their Beliall with our Chriſt. And therefore though the foreſayde cuſtome be begon, and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the popiſhe ſynagogue, as ratified by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conſent of the popes ſubiectes: Yet the ſame cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, ought not eyther to be begone, or to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Churche of Chriſt, as indeede, a cuſtome neuer yet, by the conſent of the Lord himſelfe, nor any his faithful ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, approued to be, any whit expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or neceſſarie, for the good gouernment of his church. And hauing thus layde this foundation, it is farther to be vnderſtoode, that euery reaſonable cuſtome, euerie cuſtome not erronious, and lawfully preſcribed, ought to haue theſe properties following: The firſte is this, viz. It muſt be begon, and continued, <note place="margin">ff de leg. l. ſed et.</note>

For what preiudice, can the couenaunt of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1795:92"/> the popiſhe Clergye, worke againſt the Citizens of the Lord, the profeſſours of the Goſpel: For though thoſe Byſhops, haue vſed this authoritie, by the ſpace well nighe of three hundred yeares, what is that to our By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who haue not had the vſe, poſſeſsion and light of the Goſpell ſcarcelye threeſcore yeares? in whiche time too, there hath beene a continuall outcry, made by the Lords ſeruants againſt this abuſe, and a conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall clayme for the reſtitution of the Lords owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Lords people, might be gouerned, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to his ordinances.

               <p>THe firſt propoſition is the lawe it ſelfe: the ſecond propoſition, I confirme thus.

Firſt, (as I ſayd before) they haue not bene in poſſeſsion of their offices vnder the Goſpell, ſo manye yeares as are ſufficient to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a cuſtome. Secondly, whereas a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all clayme by open writinges and preachinges, hath beene made to the contrarie, it appeareth that the poſſeſsion they haue, is altogether forced, and violent, and therefore an vniuſt poſſeſsion. And as touching the number of yeares before mentioned, I would not haue the Papiſte, or any other take anye aduauntage by thoſe ſpeaches, as though I ment, that the Goſpel hath not beene preached theſe threeſcore yeeares (a time ſufficient in Lawe to preſcribe a cuſtome) in as muche as I knowe that the Goſpell nowe preached, is the ſame Goſpell that hath beene preached from the beginning: yea, that hath beene from all eternity, and preached by the Lorde Chriſte himſelfe, in the dayes of his humanitie, and continued in his Churche euer ſince by his true diſciples: but my meaning is, that ſince the time of the reſtitution thereof, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of his people, from out of the captiuitie of the ſpiritual whore of Babylon, there hath not yet ſo many yeeres paſſed, as may ſerue for a lawfull cuſtome to the Byſh. vnder the Goſpell, againſt their fellow brethren: For though they ſucceede the Apoſtles, and primitiue Churche in ſoundnes of doctrine, and teach the ſame ſaluation that our ſauiour himſelfe taught, and ſo haue a continuaunce, and a poſſeſsion of the doctrine
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1795:93"/> of faith: Yet thereby, or therefore it followeth not, that they likewiſe haue, or may challenge the like defence for the former cuſtome. The Apoſtles them ſelues, and the primitiue Church, neuer vſing any ſuch authority, and therefore no ſuch authority to be deriued, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from them, as in deed neuer begun, or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by them. And therfore for this cauſe, and in this reſpect alſo the former cuſtome, as an vnreaſonable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, is in truth no cuſtome at all. For <hi>Conſuetudo irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionabilis amittit nomen conſuetudinis, &amp; appellatur corruptela.</hi>

I ſay, this cuſtome in the Church of Chriſte, is an vnreaſonable cuſtome, as neuer begun by the Apoſtles and ſeruauntes of Chriſt, and therefore not to be continued by the followers &amp; ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles; the Apoſtles both teaching &amp; practizing the cleane contrary. And therfore as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry law againſt the law of God, is an vnreaſonable law, and therefore in truth no law: So euerye cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of God, is an vnreaſonable cuſtome, and ſo in deed no cuſtome. <hi>Conſuetudo</hi> ſayth <hi>Anto. de Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo, ſi tendit ad foelicitatem animae eſt rationabilis, ſi vero repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnat fini aeterno, conſuetudo est irrationabilis.</hi> A cuſtome if it tende to the happineſſe of the ſoule, it is a reaſonable cuſtome: but if it repugne the ende eternall, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is vnreaſonable.

               <p>THe ſeconde propoſition of this ſyllogiſme, hath bene prooued before, namely, for that the Apoſtles haue taught and practiſed the contrary. And in truth, as hath beene already prooued, it was begun, aboue a thouſand yeeres after the Apoſtles times, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med onely by a Pope, vppon a politique reaſon, drawn from the gouernment of common weales: namely, for that matters committed to one, may in reaſon be eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier and ſpeedilier diſpatched, then matters committed to many. <note place="margin">1.

Nowe the auncient Canons you haue ſeene before to be contrary; and therfore what may be concluded, let euery one iudge. And hereby two other notable defects and impediments appeare againe, to be in this cuſtome, which cannot be in any cuſtome lawfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. <note place="margin">A cuſtome not begun in good faith, no law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful cuſtome.</note> The one, that it was not begun <hi>Bona fide, &amp; iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto titulo,</hi> By good fayth, and vppon a iuſt Title: the other, that it was begun, thorough want of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trueth, and ſo ignorauntlye and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly:

               <p>Whatſoeuer is begunne and continued in the Churche, agaynſt or without the commaundement of GOD, as the ſame muſt needes bee, begun <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la fide, &amp; iniusto titulo,</hi> by an euill conſcience, and by an vnlawfull title; ſo muſt it followe that the ſame is begunne alſo, without knowledge of the truethe: for that neyther any good fayth, neyther any trueth, can bee founde to bee in any thing, that is contrarye or without the worde of God. And therefore this cuſtome is agayne for theſe two reſpects, vtterlye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and therefore doth not excuſe agaynſte common righte. <note place="margin">Extra. de conſuet. c. cum olim.</note>

Nowe, that no Byſhoppe by common right, coulde excommunicate, correct, or puniſh his ſubiectes alone before the time, that <hi>Boniface</hi> the eyghte had giuen ſentence for the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of <hi>Pictauia,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 6. de conſuet. c. non. eſt.</note> agaynſte the Deane and Chapter of the ſame Churche, complayning that the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe had dealt iniuriouſlye with them for that hee had exerciſed Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theire Counſayle, hath beene alreadye prooued by the Canons and Conſtitutions before ſpecified. Which Canons were decreed long before, and nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Apoſtles time, and accordinge to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and vſadge of the aunciente Fathers. And therefore, ſince this Cuſtome, hath had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but in the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eyghte, (no lawefull ſucceſſor of the Apoſtles) and that vppon a reaſon of pollitike gouerment, and not vppon the worde of God: and that the lawe before was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, yea and is contrarye ſtill: where noe ſuche cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome hath beene ſo preſcribed: I conclude, that in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1795:95"/> beginning it was not ſo, and therefore contrary to the commaundement of God, and therfore vnreaſonable, and therefore no cuſtome, but a corruption. <note place="margin">Euerye cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome muſt be lawfully preſcribed.</note> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond property of euery good and laudable cuſtome in the Church, is, that the ſame be rightly and lawfully preſcribed, otherwiſe it ſhall looſe the nature of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and be of no force to binde. And to ſuch a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome theſe two thinges are neceſſarily requyred. <note place="margin">Gloſ. extra. de conſuetud c. cum quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> Firſt, the ſame muſt be begun, <hi>Sciente illo qui ius poteſt condere,</hi> With the knowledge and conſent of him, that hath power to make a law. Secondly it muſt not be <hi>Contra neruum eccleſiasticae diſciplinae, &amp; libertatem eccleſiae:</hi> Againſt the ioyntes and ſinewes of eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, and liberty of the Church. Touching the former, we are firſt to conſider the ſtate and condition of Pope Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, whether he as a lawfull king, gouernour, or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, had power and authoritie to inact, and publiſhe, a law, in the Church of Chriſt or no? For had he no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to make a law in the Church of Chriſte, then by the foreſayd maxime, it followeth; that he had no authoritie, to confirme or eſtabliſh a cuſtome. Now it is manifeſt, that the Popes kingdome, is an vſurped kingdome: that his power is not lawfully deriued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by the word of the Lord: that it is a kingdome more oppoſite, and altogeather contrary to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt: that it proclaymeth doctrines againſt the doctrines of our Lord Chriſt: that it vrgeth tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt his commaundements: that it inuenteth new ſacrifices, and diſanulleth his onely, and all ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſacrifice: that it is externall, and conſiſteth in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pompes, rites, and ceremonies, whereas the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our Lord Chriſt is ſpirituall, and conſiſteth in the renuing the inner man. If then, there be ſuch diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and diſſention betweene theſe two kingdoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the diuers gouernments of theſe two kinges: (I terme the Pope a king, onely in reſpect of his vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1795:95"/> kingdome) the one gouerning his ſubiects, by the ſword of the ſpirite, the worde of God, the other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning his adherents, by the inuentions of men, and traditions of his owne braine, it ſtandeth vs the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruaunts, and ſubiects of the Lord Chriſt in hand, that as we are exempted by his grace and power, from the bondage of our enemy: ſo to exempt our ſelues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acknowledging any power, to bee in his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make a lawe, or to eſtabliſh a cuſtome for vs to be ruled &amp; gouerned by. And as the papiſt, to manifeſt his obedience to the Pope, will affirme this cuſtome, to bee avayleable in the gouernement of the popiſhe churche, and to bee good, as brought in by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their King the Pope: ſo it ſtandeth vpon our allegiaunce and fidelitie to our King Ieſus Chriſt, not to confeſſe this cuſtome to bee commendable, but as it is, ſo to account the ſame, altogether corrupt, as bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not brought into the Church, with the knowledge of the ſame our King, who hath only power to make a law in his Church, but rather foyſted in, by the power of an vſurper, contrarye to our ſaide King, his expreſſe will, and commaundement. In deede if our Byſhops, and other Church gouernours, were popiſh byſh. &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Pope, for their general ſuperintende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and that he had power, to make a law: they might then ſeeme, to haue ſome reaſon by alleadging this cuſtome for their defence? neither could I then deny the vſe, and authority thereof vnto them. But the caſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth otherwiſe with them. Our Byſhops pretend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee enimyes, vnto the Popes vſurped power: they would bee no maineteyners of his authority, they confeſſe not him, to haue power to make a law, they ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>count and repute him to be meere Antichriſt. Yea our Byſhops are miniſters of the Goſpell, they are diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the worde of God, they bee Legates from the Lord Chriſt, to declare his good pleaſure to his people.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1795:96"/> And therefore the ſtate of our queſtion is otherwiſe, and ſtandeth thus: namely, whether a cuſtome begun, and continued in the ſynagogue of Antichriſt, with the knowledge of him, that in that ſynagogue had power to make a Lawe, bee a good, and a laudable cuſtome, for the Church of Chriſt, being begun, &amp; continued, without the knowledge of the Lorde Chriſte: And whether the miniſters of the Goſpell, may ſafely chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, the vſe, or benefite, of any ſuch cuſtome in the miniſtery of the Goſpell or no? Whereunto I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, and that by Lawe negatiuely. For, making the Kingdome of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſtery of his Goſpell, to bee as it is indeede, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of power and grace, and to bee a Kingdome oppoſite and contrary to the kingdome of Antichriſt: I ſay that there can be no cuſtome brought into his Churche, nor practiſed by the miniſters of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, vnleſſe the ſame bee broughte in by the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and conſent of their Lorde and King Ieſus Chriſte, who onely hath power to make a lawe for them to be gouerned by. And that therefore vnleſſe it may be iuſtified, that this cuſtome, (namely that one ſhoulde excommunicate alone) was brought in with the knowledge and conſent of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte: I ſay, that by Lawe this cuſtome is a voide cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. And therefore I conclude thus:

                     <item>1 Euery cuſtome begunne and continued in the Church of Chriſte, without the knowledge and conſent of Chriſte, who onely in his Churche hath power to make a Law, is no cuſtome law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſcribed.</item>

               </p>
               <p>THe firſt Propoſition is drawn from the eſſence, &amp; nature of the pollicy of the Church of Chriſt, for that no other pollicy, can bee the pollicy of the church of Chriſt, than that pollicy, which is inſtituted by God, the Lorde and Father of Chriſte, for God is the onely
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1795:97"/> head of Chriſte, and the lawe giuer vnto Chriſte: for whatſoeuer I haue receiued (ſaith Chriſte) that haue I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded you. And that which I receiued of the Lord, (ſaith the Apoſtle) that I haue deliuered vnto you. Now it is manifeſt that both our Sauiour Chriſte, &amp; his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <note place="margin">1. Cor.. 5. 4. 5.

And if excommunication by manye bee commaunded by God, then excommunication by one alone, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by God. The ſecond propoſition I proue thus:
<list>
                     <item>1 Whatſoeuer is the tradition, and inuention of man, the ſame is not the inſtitution of God.</item>
                     <item>2 But a cuſtome wherebye one ſhoulde excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate alone, is a tradition and inuention of man.</item>

               </p>
               <p>THe firſt propoſition is manyfeſt by infinite places of Scriptures, &amp; eſpecially by the doctrine of our Sauiour, in the fiftenth after <hi>Mathew,</hi> where hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that the Phariſees (reprehending his diſciples, for not keeping the traditions of the Elders, in waſhinge their hands) haue made the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nt of God, of noe aucthority, by their owne tradition, manifeſtinge thereby that in vain they worſhipped him, teaching for doctrines mens preceptes. The ſecond propoſition of this ſyllogiſme, with the ſecond propoſition of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſyllogiſme, is proued by the decree of <hi>Boneface</hi> the eyght before alleadged: which <hi>Boniface,</hi> was a man: was a Pope, and Gouernour in the Church of Rome, &amp; was an enimy to the inſtitution, &amp; ordinance of God.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1795:98"/> And therfore againſt the force and vertue of the ſayde cuſtome as not lawfully preſcribed, and therefore not hauing ſufficient power and authoritie, of an equall &amp; iuſt vnwritten law, beeing brought into the Church about three hundred yeares paſſed, and that by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eyght, an enemy vnto the church: I conclude thus:

                     <item>1 No cuſtome againſt the force of eccleſiaſticall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, can bee a cuſtome lawfully preſcribed: for the law warranteth no ſuch cuſtome:</item>

And therefore our ſole cuſtomarie excommunicatours, ſhall come to late to deny the concluſion. I made mention before of one other condition properly incident, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to euery cuſtome lawfully preſcribed, namely that the ſame ſhoulde not be againſte the libertye of the Church of Chriſte.

And therefore whereſoeuer, eyther by violence or poſitiue lawe, any one man, in any one place, vſurpeth power to excommunicate alone: there, the whole companye of the faythfull in that place, is ſecluded from this franck ability, to doe what it woulde in the ſpirituall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Lorde: whereſoeuer (I ſay) this freedome is after this ſort, by a certayne violence, or poſitiue Lawe, wreſted out of the power of the Church, ſo that ſhee hath not free liberty to execute her will: namely, to baniſh from her ſociety and fellowſhippe, all ſuch as haue by their owne miſdemeanour, baniſhed them ſelues from the obedience of the Lorde: it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily followe, that therfore, for one to excommunicate alone, is againſt the liberty of the Church, bringing the Church into extreame bondage and ſeruitude: For as by the reaſon of the naturall man: <hi>Seruitus eſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio iuris gentium, qua quis dominio alieno contra naturam ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticitur:</hi> Seruitude is a conſtitution of the lawe of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby agaynſt nature any man is ſubiect to the Dominion of another: euen ſo by the reaſon of the worke of the ſpirite, that, without contradiction is to be reputed a ſpirituall ſeruitude, whereby the Church of God, contrary to the Law of God, is brought vnder any ſtraunge and forraine gouernment: And therfore, I conclude thus.

And as touching eccleſiaſtical coertion, if any of hir people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be puniſhed by the eccleſiaſtical miniſtery, hir
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1795:102"/> highnes demandeth no other ſoueraignty, then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde the miniſtery to exerciſe the diſcipline of the Church againſte the offenders, as by the lawes of God they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded: and in caſe they of the miniſterie, ſhalbe herein remiſſe &amp; negligent, then to puniſh them with ſuch paines, as either by hir lawes is prouided, or by hir wiſdom ſhalbe thought expedient in that behalf, for the contempt of hir gratious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Lords ſeruice. In which diuerſitie of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the diuerſitie of the offices, of magiſtracie and miniſtery, doth manifeſtly appeare. Magiſtracie hauing euermore regarde to the bodye and outwarde man: but miniſtery alwayes to the ſoule, and inner man. The magiſtrate puniſheth with bodily chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with ſpiritual diſcipline, neither doth thone hereby derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, or any whit weaken the other, but rather ech one ſtrengthneth &amp; fortifieth the other. For the mind brought in frame by diſcipline, frameth the whole body to a more holy obedience, ſo that the magiſtrate therby hath leſſe trouble in his office, &amp; the common weal more floriſheth in peace and proſperity. Which difference, were it well weighed, &amp; without ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling thorowly marked, would ſoone decide this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy. For hereby the former ſtatute, touching the exerciſe of eccleſiaſtical diſcipline by Doctors of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile law (meere lay men) would clearly appeare to haue been made in a time, wherein the truth was not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted as now it is. For if euery man ought to confeſſe that it is vnlawful by the word of God, for a king and Potentate, no miniſter of the Goſpell to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and ſo conſequently, vnlawfull to execute the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a miniſter: euerye man ought much more to confeſſe, that authoritie giuen by man to a kinges vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall no miniſter of the Goſpell, to excommunicate, and ſo conſequently to execute the miniſters office, is an authority giuen vnto man againſte the lawe of God,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1795:103"/> and therefore both the lawe ſpeedely to be repealed, and the abuſe in the meane time to be refourmed. And therefore I conclude againſt that ſtatute thus from the greater to the leſſe.

And though it may be aunſwered that ſome of theſe no Doctors, were, or be Deacons, and ſo Cleargie men, and therefore no laie men: I reply though they were, or be in deed Deacons, and ſo one kinde of Cleargie men, that they can not therefore excommunicate, &amp;c. <note place="margin">De regni iuris. li. 6. ea.</note>

Truely no. Becauſe it belongeth to a Biſhop onely to giue forty dayes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1795:104"/> and not an hundred. In like manner I conclude, though ſome in authoritie exerciſing eccleſiaſtical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be Deacons, yet notwithſtanding that their ſayde cenſure, is in lawe no cenſure, as a thing not belonging to the office of a Deacon, but onely to the office of a miniſter. There remayneth yet one other obiection, namely that excommunication is not vſed, as an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall but rather as a ciuil puniſhment. Whereunto I anſwere, that ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeak altogeather without book, &amp; that by law they ſhal neuer be able to iuſtify their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, to be a ciuile puniſhment, the ſame man is ſhrewdly to be ſuſpected, to be a priuie and ſubtil ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vnto the Church, for therby he excludeth all kind of puniſhmente from the Church. And I include vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Excommunication, Suſpenſion, Interdiction and admonition. For if Excommunication bee Ciuill, then are theſe alſo ciuill, and if theſe bee ciuill, then what is Eccleſiaſticall? But ſuch men by vndermining the Churche, to mayntayne their owne corrupt abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, require ſome ſharper medicine of pure eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Diſcipline, to heale their vnciuill behauiour, and therfore that excommunication cannot be a ciuill pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, I prooue this from the diſcription thereof. <note place="margin">ij. q. 2. nihil. §. euidenter. ij. q. 3. nemo.</note>

For they aſcribe vnto hir maieſtie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, truth, and veritie, that which the others do but in worde, ſhew, and ſemblaunce onely: They earneſtly deſire and craue, that as hir highneſſe hath beene an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted and Crowned, by the Lord him ſelfe, Queene and gouerneſſe ouer them: and as ſhe is their naturall and onely lawfull Ladie and Miſtreſſe: and as ſhe hath the name title and ſtile of ſupreame and chiefe ruler ouer all perſons, &amp; in all cauſes: So likewiſe the cauſes now acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted Eccleſiaſticall, beeing meere Ciuill, ſhee might in deed, truth, and veritie, haue all and all maner of iuriſdiction executed in hir maieſties owne name, as well in Courts and iudgements nowe reputed Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, as in other hir maieſties Courtes temporall, whereby hir Ciuill gouernement might be more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. Which thing the abettours of reformation perceiue now to be otherwyſe. Forall ſummons, actes, proceedinges, ſentences, decrees, and iudgementes in all cauſes and controuerſies determinable, before Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Archdeacons, are begunne, continued and ended, in the Archbiſhops, biſhops, Archdeacons, their Commiſſaries or Officials, names, ſtiles and dignities, without any relation or mention of authoritie gyuen unto them, as proceeding from hir maieſtie, then the which there can not ſeeme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye thing more preiudiciall, to hir ſtate, Crowne and dignitie. For be it that they be created Archbiſhops and Biſhops, by hir highneſſe, and inueſted into their ſeas at hir Graces commaundement: yet this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no greater prerogatiue belonging vnto hir maieſty

Henry c. 16.</note> The ſtatute made, that euery Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and biſhop of this realme, and of other the kings dominions may miniſter, vſe, and exerciſe all and euery thing, and thinges, pertayning to the office or order of an Archbiſhop and biſhop, with all tokens, enſignes, and ceremonyes therevnto belonging, and that all Archdeacons, and Deanes, and other hauing offices, cures, and dignities ſpiritual, may by authoritie of this act, and not by vertue of any forren power, or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, adminiſter, vſe, and exerciſe, all things appertaining to their dignities, offices, orders, cures, religions, felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and may lawfully hereafter vſe, all tokens, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and ceremonyes, which they haue beene accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to vſe in times paſt, ſo it be not expreſly, againſt the lawes of God, and this Realme: This ſtatute I ſay, hauing beene the rule of our Archbiſhops and biſhops conſciences, for their gracinges, there Lordinges, there vſheringes, their kneelinges, there taſtinges, their cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearinges, and ſuch like, improoueth no whit any part of the force of the former aſſertions: but rather confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and fortifieth the ſame. Firſt the ſtatute hauing relation onely to tokens, enſignes, and ceremonies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomably adminiſtred, vſed, and exerciſed before the making of the ſtatute; all which beeing Antichriſtian, and therefore expreſlye againſt the lawes of God, are plainely by this ſtatute abrogated, and therfore ought no more to bee adminiſtred, vſed or exerciſed. For though the Kinge, the peeres, and commons at that time, not inſtructed in the vnlawfulneſſe of them, did not holde and repute them to be againſte the lawes of God, and therefore did not ſpecially abridge any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler rites, enſignes, and ceremonies, &amp;c. yet now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1795:118"/> much as we are certaynely infourmed, that they bee altogeather Antichriſtian, and therefore expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the worde of God, we maye and ought to vrge the generall intendement of the ſtatute, generally to take them awaye. Secondly, were not the foreſayde popiſhe rites, enſignes, and ceremonyes, Antichriſtian, and expreſly againſt the lawes of GOD, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this braunche of the ſtatute might bee mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, vſed and exerciſed; yet notwithſtanding, it is manifeſt that the ſayde rites, enſignes, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, haue not beene appoynted by the prerogatiue of anye of the Kinges of this Realme, but haue beene transferred from Italye vnto Englande, by a forren and vſurped power, and therefore by the ſeconde braunch of the ſtatute, as thinges authorized contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to the Lawes of the Realme, are not anye more to be vſed, or exerciſed. In the time of King Henry the ſeconde, we haue ſeene before, that this priuiledge was graunted to Archbiſhops and Biſhops, that they ſhoulde holde their poſſeſsions of the King, as a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronie, and ſhoulde be preſent in the Kinges courtes, as other of his Barons. If in theſe dayes they did ſitte them ſelues in their owne Conſiſtories, and exerciſe gouernement by the lyke authoritie, their Courtes happely woulde not be ſo contemptible as they bee, nor their iudgement ſeates, ſo abuſed as they are. The people woulde be better quyeted in thoſe places: and offer leſſe iniurie to the magiſtrate, then now they doe. And therefore I conclude, that though hir highneſſe and the lawes indirectly, and as it were <hi>ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere,</hi> tollerate theſe men to rule and gouerne, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe forreigne lawes, whereof they haue the execution: yet the more faythfull and loyall euery ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is, the more he ſhould and doth contende, to haue the whole and entyre gouernement of the Church and Common weale, directly, immediately, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1795:118"/> to ſpring from hir highneſſe, as from the heade and fountaine vnder Chriſte, of all gouernement to be executed amongeſt hir ſubiectes. In dooing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they ſhall dutifully and Chriſtianly more and more mayntaine hir prerogatiue. The Emperour forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Eccleſiaſticall men, to vſurpe Ciuill offices, loſt no whit of his imperiall prerogatiue ouer the ſubiectes, yea rather, hereby he openly declared the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his Empyre, and the abſolute authoritie he had ouer them: and that as well by forbidding things not to be doone, as by commaunding thinges to bee done. <note place="margin">Enemies of reformation enemies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hir maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue.</note> For though he ſpoyled them of vnlawfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminences, yet he enriched them with lawful liberties, I know not the inward intent and meaning of ſuch as miſlike to haue ciuill gouernment tranſlated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh.

But if I may ſpeake that which may ſhrewdly be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they may ſeeme to be greater enemies to hir high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes prerogatiue then others be. For though outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in wordes they ſeeme to graunt vnto hir all libertye in the diſpoſition of ciuill offices (whervnto the others do likewiſe agree and condiſcende): yet they ſeeme in deede to be loath ſhe ſhoulde drawe the ſword of hir prerogatiue, &amp; cut a ſunder the coards of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. They graunt hir authoritie to make them ſelues iuſtices of peace, and eccleſiaſticall commiſsioners, and ſo wage law for hir prerogatiue. An eaſie matter for them to ſtande in, &amp; plauſible to fleſh and bloud: their outwarde man delighteth with outwarde pompe and credit. But ſuppoſe the caſe ſtood between the Archb. Biſh. and Archd. and hir maieſty for hir prerogatiue in aboliſhing their iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlating the ſame to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; &amp; that the matter were to be decided by the gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt part of their own voyces, &amp; that their voyces were to be giuen in ſcrutiny, &amp; not any waies to be knowen who had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his voice, with or againſt hir prerogatiue
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1795:119"/> in this caſe (I feare me) rather then their Lordeſhippes ſhoulde take the foyle, they woulde lay hir prerogatiue in the duſt: ſelfe loue woulde haue a ſtrooke, and fleſhe and bloud woulde be loath to looſe any liberty. The hiſtory of Henry the fifth, and the Oration of Henry Chychuby, Archbiſhop of Caunterbury, made in the Parliament houſe, to alienate the Kings minde, and to diſſwade his Nobles, from the enterpriſe whereof hee and they had conſulted, touching the ouerthrow of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious houſes, and to draw their endeuours to make warre, and to leauie an armie againſt the French king, might be a forcible argument to anye, to perſwade him ſelfe the ſame thing in this caſe, though he had no other reaſon to induce him therevnto. But the vnci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill intreaty of hir highneſſe owne ſchollers elected by hir gratious commaundemement from Weſtminſter to hir owne Colledges in Cambridge and Oxenforde, euen by ſuch as would ſeeme in words to ſet vp migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie propes vnder hir prerogatiue, argueth manifeſtlye the ſame thing. For otherwiſe hir maieſties ſchollers in all reſpectes as well qualified as their owne, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes elected halfe a yeare before their owne, might once in the ſpace of twenty foure yeares, though not for their owne ſakes, yet for their honorable Lady and miſtreſſe ſake, haue receiued ſome more fauourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment and preferment in thoſe houſes then hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they haue done. The maiſters of thoſe houſes woulde not haue placed them next vnto the ſcreene, and ſet them next vnto the Porters lodge as by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto fellowſhips in the one, &amp; ſchoolerſhips in the other, they a long time haue doone. Whereas on the contrary ſide it is apparantly knowen, that ſometimes the Dean of Chriſt church in Oxenford, a great friend to reformation, and a man for his excellent knowledge and wiſedome in gouernment, ſingularly commended euen by his enemies, in theſe ſmall matters gaue an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1795:119"/> and rare example of his humble dutie and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie vnto hir highnes. For the reuerent eſtimation he had, &amp; caryed of &amp; vnto hir highnes ordinance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, he placed a ſcholler ſent thither by hir maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties appointment, firſte and ſenior vnto all thoſe that were elected into the houſe at that time: he him ſelfe brought the ſame hir ſcholler to his chamber, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in a Chamber and ſtudie commonly appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ancients of the houſe: all his owne ſchollers were inferior vnto hirs, and placed beneath hirs. Since the departure of which man, if the Audite or butterie bookes of that houſe were ſought, you ſhall finde hir ſchollers names, written alwayes in the latter ende of the booke, the laſt of forty, and placed after his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, whom hir highneſſe but the day before, had prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be a Deane or prebendary in that houſe. The Deanes ſchollers they goe and ſit, and are placed fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: the prebendaries in the middeſt, and hirs hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: and if they were to go a proceſsion, as in the time of popery, hirs muſt go foremoſt, as vnworthieſt to go next to the croſſe. And becauſe hir maieſtie ſometimes by hir letters heretofore requeſted the Deane and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, to receiue into hir Colledge ſuch as ſhe thought meet to be placed: Now forſoth, to preuent hir boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnes, and to take awaye all occaſion from others to ſeeke preferment in that houſe at hir maieſties hands, they of late haue inuented a new deuice, and practized a new tricke, where they were by the order, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the houſe, bound yearely to make elections of ſuch ſchollers as might preſently at the time of the election be placed in the vacant roomes, they now either at one time chooſe a greater number of ſchollers for them ſelues, then are places vacant and ſo make but one election in two yeares, or elſe ſo ſoone as any place by the departure of any ſchooler is voyd, they foorthwith in the name of the Deane or ſome

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince they ſtriue ſo egerly for ſuch tryfles, and vſe ſuch foule ſhiftes, to ſhut hir out of doores, and make hir ſchollers packehorſes, and ſet them at the Cartes tayle, in hir owne Colledges: I thinke a man may geſſe twice, and yet not geſſe ſo nigh, as to geſſe that Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie men, enemies to reformation, rather then they woulde looſe their dignities, woulde, if it laye in their power, gyue hir Highneſſe prerogatiue the Canuyſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe. They allow hir maieſtie a royall power to ſhred greene Olyue braunches, but to roote vp olde rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dotterelles, they deny hir anye ſuch authoritie: they can bee contented hir maieſtie ſhoulde ſtrippe poore men cloathed with ſackecloath; but mighty men decked in ſcarelet ſhee may not touch, or once looke awrye vppon. <note place="margin">No cauſe of the name of eccleſiaſtical court.</note> Concerning the Courtes and iudgement ſeates of Archbiſhops, biſhops, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons hitherto reputed and called Eccleſiaſticall Courtes, I can ſee no reaſon in the worlde, why they ſhoulde be any more ſo eſteemed, taken or reputed, or why anye matter, or cauſe, or ſuite, or controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie commenced in thoſe places, ſhoulde or ought to be called or counted Eccleſiaſticall.

For in trueth they doe leſſe good vnto vs, then an Herb-Iohn doth (as is ſayde) in the Potage: for that Herbe doth neyther good nor harme. But theſe Lawes doe annoye vs vvonderfullye, and they doe vs no manner of good at all. They are altogether
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1795:122"/> needeleſſe, they are altogether Booteleſſe, I woulde to GOD they were altogether footeleſſe too. For touching the gouernment of the Church, wee haue firſt the perfect and altogether righteous Lavve of God to rule the ſame by: Secondlye, wee haue her Maieſties Iniunctions, the common and Statute Laws of the Realme, and the prouinciall conſtitutions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning in effect, whatſoeuer ought in anye caſe by any ſubiect, to bee practiſed within this Realme. Touching the adminiſtration of Iuſtice in anye ciuill cauſe before mentioned, and wherof practiſe is made in the eccleſiaſticall Court, there is nothing good in the whole body of the Canon Lawe, concerning the ſame, but the ſame hath beene culled out of the Ciuill Lawe, it is but an Epitomy of the Ciuill Law.</p>
               <p>The rules of the Cannon Lawe, are for the moſt part, rules taken out of the Ciuill Lawe: onely there is this difference, that by the Cannon Lawe, a man in ſome caſe, ſhall not in his whole life time get an end of his ſuyte (as theſe parties that had a cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending in the Popes Court twentye foure yeeres, and yet in all that ſpace, <hi>Lis non erat contestata,</hi> an iſſue could not bee ioyned) wheras by Ciuill Law, a cauſe in the firſt inſtaunce ought to bee finiſhed within three yeeres at the vtmoſte, or elſe the Agent becommeth non ſuite.</p>
               <p>And if vppon cauſe the matter bee appealed after definitiue ſencence, the ſame cauſe of appeale, ought ordinarily to bee ended within one yeare, or vppon ſome iuſt cauſe extraordinarilye happening vvithin two years. Otherwiſe the appeale is fruſtrate, ſo that in both inſtaunces fiue yeares onely muſt bee ſpent in ſuit of law.</p>
               <p>And nowe what reaſon is there, that the Canon Lawe ſhold be ſtill canonized amongſt vs? when it was ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that none ſhould proceed in any vniuerſity doctor
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1795:123"/> of the Canon lawe. I thinke the meaning of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance cheefly was, that leauing no hope of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the profeſſours thereof (the thing being of it ſelfe ſo vile) they ſhoulde looſe no labour in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thereof.</p>
               <p>But I will conclude, that in as much, as by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Conſtitutions, ordinaunces and ſynodalles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall, made before the 25. yeare of Henrye the eyght, Byſhpos and all other Cleargy men are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, to be Vicountes, Preſydentes, Iuſtices, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, Bayliefes, gouernoures of Villadges, Iudges, Aduocates, Aſſeſſors, Tutors, Gardians, Ouerſeers, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagates to ſeculer Courts, farmers of temporall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, receyuers of reuenewes, preſent in anye place, where mencion of anye proceſſe or iudgement is to bee awarded agaynſte anye man, to the ſheading of bloude: And in aſmuch as they are commaunded to apply themſelues wholly to Prayer and ſupplication, and not to neglect their office, and to intangle them ſelues with worldlye buſineſſe: And for as much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as the Emperour hath vppon ſubſtantiall reaſons and principles, inhibited the Cleargy vnder his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions the like offices, to the end there mighte bee no confuſion of gouernment, nor mingling of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor Iuſtice vnminiſtred, nor one to defraude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: and for as much alſo that ſuch Canons, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, ordinaunces, and ſynodalles prouinciall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpecified, bee not contrariant nor repugnaunt, to the Lawes, Statutes, and Cuſtomes of this Realme, nor to the domage or hurt of the Queenes Prerogatiue royall, but rather for the eſtabliſhment of the ſame, the ſame Canons, beeing both founded vppon the Lawe of God, whereby her prerogatiue ſtandeth, and is vpholden: and confirmed by the Lawes of reaſon and nature, and alſo ratified by the conſent of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roures and nations, that therefore theſe Canons,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1795:123"/> conſtitutions, ordinaunces, and ſynodals prouinciall ought to be vſed and executed as they were before the making of the Act 25. Henry the eight, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vnlawfull for Archbiſhops, biſhoppes, or anie Cleargie men to beare any ciuill office in the common wealth. If any except, that before 25. of Henry the 8. biſhops and Cleargie men did vſe and execute thoſe offices, and that therefore theſe Canons were not then in vſe and executed, and therefore not in vſe now, or to be executed now. I reply, that what biſhop or Cleargie man ſoeuer, did before the 25. H. 8. vſe or execute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch office forbidden, as wherof mention hath bene made before: the ſame Byſh. or Cleargy man had ſome ſpeciall diſpenſation, faculty, or licence from the Pope ſo to doe, and that therefore the concluſion remaineth ſtill firm. For the ſtatute hath not relation to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exemptions and immunities of certain priuiled<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged perſons in this caſe, more then it hath to the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of the whole body of the canon law, wherin is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing generally forbidden, but diſpenſations were gran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, leaſte the Biſhop might inconſideratelye, and for lucre ſake, viſite a whole Citie or Dioceſſe in one daye, and ſo not onely without reaſon receiue ſo
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1795:129"/> many procurations, as there were Churches, but alſo inuert the naturall order of the policie of the Church, making the acceſſary, (namely the procuration) grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the principall, (namely the viſitation) a due and equall order was taken, that the viſitor ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him ſelfe with one procuration for one day: and that the number of procurations ſhould not exceede the number of dayes ſpent in viſitation. In which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation the Ordinarie is preciſely willed to goe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in proper perſon vnto the Church to be viſited; and may not by common right commit his office vnto any other, vnleſſe he be diſeaſed, or hauing many places about one time to viſite, coulde not, either in time of winter, by reaſon of ſnowes or inundations of waters, or in time of warre, by reaſon of perrill and danger of the enemy, commodiouſly reſort vnto euery Church. Which naturall intent, and true meaning of the law, is euidently by theſe words ſo often repeated. viz. <hi>Perſonally exerciſe: perſonally viſited: perſonally ſearching by him ſelfe with effect: perſonall viſitation: If he can not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly, or without difficultie come vnto euery one;</hi> Vppon which worde <hi>Accedere,</hi> ſayth the gloſſe, <hi>Patet ergo quod ire tenetur, nec ſufficit ad ſuam eccleſiam vocare. It appeareth therefore, that he is bound to goe, neither is it ſufficient for him to call to his owne church.</hi> Neither doth the alteration of procurations from mony vnto victuals, or from victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als vnto money, alter the nature of the firſt inſtitution of procurations. For as at the firſt it was ordayned, that the viſitor and his retinue, for the day where in he viſited, ſhould haue a moderate diet in victuals, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided at the charge of the church to be viſited: So was it neuer intended by any alteration, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue twenty or forty dayes diet in money, for viſiting twenty or forty churches, at one place in one day. <note place="margin">Lib. 6. de cenſ. c 1 § procuratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. &amp; lib. 6. cod. c. exigit.</note> But as a viſitor, by the firſt inſtitution of procurations, was to haue had his dyet in victuals, onely for one day: ſo
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1795:129"/> was he by later decrees to receiue ſo much monye, as was ſufficient for one dayes diet onely. <note place="margin">Lib. 6. de cenſ c faeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</note> Which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by the decree of <hi>Iohn Stratford,</hi> Archbyſh. of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, particularly and of purpoſe ordeined againſte the Byſhop and Archdeacon of his prouince. For (ſaith he) <hi>though the Byſhop viſite many Churches in one day, yet he ſhall haue but one procuration; whether the ſame be in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or victuall, whereunto all the Churches ſo viſited, ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally contribute.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Extrauag. commu. de cenſib. c. 1.</note> Which procuration for a Byſhops ſubſtitute is limitted by a decree of <hi>Bennet</hi> the 12. not to exceede the value of foureſcore Turons of ſiluer, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery 12. Turons making one floren of pure Golde, of an acune florentine, according to our engliſh eſtimate, not amounting in coin aboue the ſumme of fiue ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings at the vtmoſt. So that the whole procuration for one day, to bee receiued by a Byſhops ſubſtitute, of all Churches called together, ought to be at the vtmoſte, but thirty fiue ſhillings: the whole procuration of an Archdeacons ſubſtitute, for one dayes diet, ought not to exceede the ſome of 12. Shillings 6. pence, though eyther of them ſhould call 50. or an 100 Churches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one place in one day. In like manner, if the Byſhoppe perſonally, viſite by himſelfe, then is he to haue for his owne and his retinues diet, about fiue marks onely: and in caſe the Archdeacon viſite perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, then is he to receiue about twenty ſhillings one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Which procuration limitted vnto the Archdeacon by the decree of <hi>Bennet,</hi> ſeemeth to be mitigated by a prouincial conſtitution in <hi>Lindewood,</hi> whereby an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon is allowed towards one dayes diet for himſelfe and his ſeruitors, but 40. pence. Which ſumme (ſaith the gloſſe) <hi>Sufficere videtur pro quatuor perſonis, &amp; totidem equis cum vno ſummario,</hi> ſeemeth to ſuffice, for foure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſo many horſes with one ſumner. Which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et is to be vnderſtood for one day naturall, contayning 24. houres. Wherefore I conclude, that neither a Byſh.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1795:130"/> nor a Byſhops Commiſſary: that neyther an Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, nor Archdeacons officiall may at any time viſite for lucre or gaine: that hee may onely viſite then and there, when and where he knoweth iuſt cauſe of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; that he may not take an excesſiue but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate procuration: that neyther he, nor any of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue may take a reward: that he may not reap earthly things, vnleſſe he ſow ſpiritual things: that he may not (except vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vrgent necesſity) viſit more churches then one, in one day: that he may take but one prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for one day: that he may not take any procuration at al, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe he diligently performe the office of a viſitor: And laſtly, that Archb. B. &amp; Archd, ought perſonally to viſit, vnleſſe by Priuiledge they be ſpecially exempted. By which exemption, they haue onelye this libertye, that the Archb. By, &amp; Archd. ſubſtitute, may take ſo much allowances of the churches viſited, as they may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in one day, &amp; that their ſubſtitutes may not purſe vp, or cary any treaſure away, as by the decree of <hi>Bennet</hi> before alleadged is euident. For the ſame decree alloweth no more to the Archb. B. &amp; Archd. nor their ſubſtitutes, then ſo much as they may wel ſpend in one day for there diet, and other neceſſary chardges. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which priuiledge, graunted by the Canon of <hi>Bennet</hi> the 12. exempting Archbyſh. and Byſh. from necesſity of perſonall viſitation, and licenſing them to viſite by others, in as much as the ſayde Canon, being contrariant or repugnant to the Lawes, Statutes, and Cuſtomes of the Realme, or derogatory to her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe prerogatiue royall, is not therefore authorized, but rather abrogated by act of Parliament: I anſwere, that the ſayde priuiledge, is nowe a voyde priuiledge, hauing no lawe, cannon, conſtitution or ſinodall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall to iuſtify the ſame. For, whether a bull, briefe or any faculty graunted vnto any ſubiect of this realm from the ſea of Rome, in the time of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> or elſe, when for the enioying many benefices, or being
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1795:130"/> nonſident, and ſuch like, be pleydable in any her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe courtes, or allowable within any her dominions, the caſe argued not long ſince, at the barr of common pleas betweene M. Sergeant <hi>Fleetewood,</hi> and M.

Wherefore vnleſſe our Prelates will raſhly incurre, the penaltie of her highneſſe Laws inacted againſt abetters of forraigne iuriſdiction, they are well and warely to be aduiſed, not to ſticke vnto any priuiledge heretofore graunted by any Cannon, from any Pope for the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of procurations, due vnto their ſubſtitutes, the ſame Cannon as preiudiciall to the Queenes preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue royall, being abrogated: yea, they are ſoberly and in good diſcretion, to vſe the benefite of common right alone, and onlie to practiſe ſuch canons, as are in force, by the former act of Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: namely, perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to viſit in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner &amp; form before deſcribed. For if they ſhall hereafter vpon the knowledge of theſe things, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedlie attempt any thing vnto the contrarie, her maieſtie may be rightly mooued to exaſperate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to haue her ſworde whetted againſt ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. For though by ſuch kind of viſitation, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcribed by commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> right, ſome pore Archd. perhaps ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing their ſubſidies, &amp; tenthes, valued according to the rate of their procurations, might not be able, to ſatiſfie her maieſties ſaid tenths &amp; ſubſidies: yet, not onlie the reuenues of fat Archb. B. &amp; Archdeconries could be no impediment hereunto (For that they haue either lands perſonages, &amp; prebendes, to ſupply all ſuch wants) but alſo, her maieſty by ſeaſing ſome yearly portion of the ſaid procurations into her own handes, might, for the maintainaunce of her royall ſtate, both haue the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of her treaſury greatly increaſed &amp; alſo the whole miniſtery, from vnlawful exactions, lawfully releaſed.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1795:131"/> Euery miniſter woulde more freely no doubt, in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ſinguler peace hee enioyeth vnder her Maieſty, yeelde vnto her maieſty, a voluntary contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one halfe of ſuch procurations as nowe are yearely payable vnto a Byſhop or Archdeacon, rather then to pay the whole procurations vnto the ſayde B. or Archdeacon, vnder whome, and by whom, and with whome, he is at continuall Warre. And ſo where her maieſty receiueth nowe yearely, for an Archdeaconrye, valued at 40. pounds, but 4. pound by yere for tenths, her maieſty may wel receiue 20. pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> four times ſo much as at this preſent, is due: yea, &amp; where her maieſty receiueth the firſt fruites of an Archdeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry, but once in the time of a mans life, the miniſtery no doubt to be disburdened of Byſh. and Archdeacons vntollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble viſitations, will in ſteed therof cheerfully at the end of euery ten yeares, yeeld vnto her Maieſty in ſteede of the ſayd firſt fruites, the whole procurations now due vnto the ſayde Byſh. and Archdeacons, the one may hereafter lawfully be yeelded: the other hath beene heretofore vnlawfullye exacted, as appeareth by the Conons following.</p>
